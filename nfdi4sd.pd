Thomas Kuhn created the metaphor of research as puzzle solving. Rubik's cube is a paradigm for puzzle solving. Workflows with research data as synthesis of content and its paratext are best narrated by puzzling with "cubes" instead of "research data lifecycles". Aspects of research data like their metadata, provenience, or linked data: they are referenced by panels of the cube's sides. Rotations of the cube's arrangements of planes describe activities or NFDI4SD services with data. The ultimate goal is the publication of research data: when all panels on one side match, research data are open to the community for reuse.


### The task

The NFDI4SD consortium has the potential to solve a serious problem in the current state of research in the so-called small disciplines. The latter have achieved much in terms of the social and academic significance of the disciplines’ findings: small disciplines number highly in the DFG's GEPRIS database, while the number of publications in these subject areas is considerable. The data, digitised findings and digital repositories that have been acquired through the research process are also impressive. However, there is a notable lack of secondary research data, that is, data from digital sources, the research findings derived from them and the data generated specifically for research purposes; the volume of FAIR-published secondary research data is negligible in relation to the track record of the small disciplines. This contrasts starkly with the enormous importance of the small disciplines. It is these data that make it possible for researchers to access other data and repositories. Secondary data are the real engine of future digitisation. They connect the data of different collections and combine the data in meaningful ways.

Researchers cannot be held responsible for this state of affairs. Rather, it is the absence of an adequate research data infrastructure that is to blame. To help avoid these negative consequences we propose the following infrastructure for the NFDI4SD:

  - **The NFDI4SD starts already with a best practice implementation of its services on the basis of widely used and proven technological solutions.**

  - **The NFDI4SD will integrate its services into ongoing research projects from early stages of a project. The NFDI4SD’s services will become part of the research workflow and will not just be used for administrative and documentation purposes.**

  - **The concept of research data has been expanded to include content (the actual data) with its paratext. Computations then operate on comprehensive research data.**

  - **The researchers will systematically induce the development of the NFDI4SD’s services according to their needs and practices.**

  - **The NFDI4SD facilitates the publication of research data to ensure an open computational reuse according to tried-and-tested scholarly and scientific publishing conventions.**

  - **Computations with research data will be part of the work process offered by NFDI4SD as virtual workbench on the basis of ‘computational notebooks’. Such notebooks combine a textual narrative with sections of code for computations. These notebooks are the key collaborative and service tool.**

Although the infrastructure of the NFDI4SD is conceptually oriented towards the research activities of the small disciplines, thanks to its services it is open to any scholarly or scientific project, regardless of its disciplinary affiliation. Research groups or projects in the small disciplines will need to register their infrastructure service needs as early as possible (ideally before the start of a project) and coordinate the required services with the NFDI4SD. This will enable the consortium to play a constructive role in the research process by supporting the generation, systematisation, processing and evaluation of the research data right up to data publication and the subsequent reuse of the data.

The NFDI4SD uses modern computational tools to make research data usable: the data become ‘computational objects’ and thus lay the groundwork for making previously unavailable research accessible. The NFDI4SD has thus introduced a new research concept, albeit one that is not primarily concerned with technical aspects and requirements. We need to look at research data in a new operational way. The research data combine

(1) the content of the data (text, images, 3D objects, databases, programs) and
(2) the data’s paratext, that is, information on the contextual environment of the research data (such as metadata or information on the data’s provenance).

This bundle of properties and information defines the research data that is generated, published and reused in the research process.

The procedure derived from this process will enable all the internal and external participants of the research data infrastructure to collaborate fruitfully within their respective task areas (TAs). The research data will be imported during the project funding stage and then be processed further, finally being published (as ‘computational notebooks’, for instance) as quickly and sustainably as possible. The registration of the NFDI4SD’s research data will enable us to achieve another important objective: the proposed workflow will make the interdependence of the research data transparent. Which research data will be used in the calculations of other data? Scholars, scientists (hereafter also referred to as agents or researchers) or other users will thus be able to recognise the critical dependencies of their own data and will therefore be able to assess more effectively the scope of the research data in the light of a dynamically changing research landscape.

The terminology (that is, the technical language, the disciplinary categorisations or conventions) that relates to the research objects will be largely developed by the project members from the language used in their disciplines and will be standardised by communicating with each specific community. In most cases, the research projects will already have an appropriate nomenclature in place, which will be used by the NFDI4SD to prepare all the data. The members of each additional research project will contribute to building a network of semantically related research terminology. With the help of this terminology, the research data will describe the properties of the group of objects under investigation and the data will therefore become the empirical basis for the evaluation of general findings.

The NFDI4SD’s services aim to be easy to understand and user friendly. Once registered, all researchers will receive authorisation to access the NFDI4SD’s cloud services.

  - Researchers of all qualification levels and group sizes will control the requirements of the NFDI4SD’s services through the needs of their research projects. A group of co-spokespeople from task area one – **TA1 (research fields)** – will mediate and monitor the coordination process and will introduce the interests of the researchers to the NFDI4SD’s steering committee. As demand grows and the research fields increasingly differentiate, membership of the group of co-spokespeople is likely to be extended.

  - It will be possible to access NFDI4SD’s services from, for example, the working environment of a ‘computational notebook’. Simply by inserting an additional line into the notebook, the functions can be switched from a local installation to the use of NFDI4SD’s cloud services. **TA2** will develop the resources for the NFDI4SD’s cloud service, in particular the innovative components of machine learning and big data.

  - **TA3** will develop and operate all the services and offers that are needed to promote the visibility of collaborations and the reuse of the research data. The publication of research data is as much a part of this field of activity as are further education and training.

  - **TA4** The collaborative reuse of data will be based on normative data and standards. Usage metrics and ongoing quality assessment of the NFDI4SD will provide immediate feedback, which can be used to improve future research needs.

  - **TA5** This task area is a vital interface for the institutional partners, the external data sources and the research repositories. It will draw up the licence agreements with the partners and will also coordinate the dissemination of the publications and the NFDI4SD’s services to the academic community and to the interested but non-technical general public.

  - **TA6** Every publication and every reuse of research data is protected by copyright. Researchers should, from the start of a project, be aware of and comply with copyright issues; NFDI4SD's deep learning-based virtual assistants will provide support in this area. This task area will ensure that researchers know and follow the legal requirements in good time as well as help them submit proposals for the benefit of researchers and science in general.


### Benefits

#### Research

Conceptually, we will use research data in an entirely new way. Not unlike the process of transforming a manuscript into a book, the NFDI4SD will turn computational content into academically usable research data. Researchers will be able to publish their key findings and introduce them to the community while they are still conducting their research: the findings will be immediately documented and they can then be incorporated into the researchers’ own work as well as into the main project. The NFDI4SD consortium will ensure that valuable research findings are preserved and remain accessible in the long term without any additional effort or infrastructure costs.

#### Young scholars and scientists

The NFDI4SD will support budding academics from the very beginning of their research and will free them from any additional expenses. While a dissertation is being written up, young scholars and scientists will be able to compile simultaneously any essential research data in a format that will enable the data to be cited in a paper or a data collection and, after it has been successfully completed, published as research data together with the dissertation. This will considerably increase the scientific impact of the research work.

#### Content providers, libraries, archives and repositories

The digital resources of libraries, archives, repositories and research institutes that are now accessible have opened up a substantial part of our cultural heritage. These sources should not only be passively appreciated. According to the NFDI4SD’s new concept, the content of these sources has become research data that can be directly incorporated into the research process with very little effort. The author and funding institution details are entered into the paratext database, and, because it is fully integrated, the content of the research data can also be included in all future research data. The value of the research data of these institutions will also be enhanced by the subsequent publication of the data. Small and specialized collections, in particular, are becoming more important as they are now being integrated into every data collection. Future researchers will be able to use the digital collections of other research institutions to expand their empirical base. The latest machine-learning techniques and global connectivity will enhance the effectiveness of all digitised content, which will enable researchers to access their own data stores without having to finance it.

#### Community

Unpublished research data that was previously lost after the completion of a project will now be made available. Research data used to be understood as the material commonly accepted as necessary in the scientific community to validate the resulting research findings of a scientific investigation; once the studies had been published, though, there was no infrastructure to make the data usable or to present them as independent research findings. Now, however, it will be possible to publish independently the research data of all subject areas, but especially those of the small disciplines. We should therefore see a rise in the quality and relevance of special research areas in academia generally.

#### Funding institution

The findings of funded projects will be able to reach the academic community more swiftly; this will help the actors to identify new trends as quickly as possible and to establish the needs of newly oriented research fields. The value of research funding is greatly enhanced thanks to the support provided by the research data infrastructure. Previously unused resources of research data will be made accessible with little additional effort and they will significantly increase the value of the existing data that is to be reused.

The NFDI4SD addresses the European Union's growing concern about the loss of 'digital sovereignty'. The small disciplines, in particular, explore the many different dimensions of our cultural heritage: from languages, culture, history and the sciences to our political and social identity, they increase our understanding of our culture. By publishing research data, the NFDI4SD will store and link the network of our cultural heritage and contribute to making it autonomous, open access and reusable. Maintaining digital sovereignty is a vital feature of the design of the NFDI4SD's infrastructure.

Ongoing digitalisation and the Open Access movement are transforming the research process and are greatly increasing the dissemination of research data. As a result, academic institutions – such as universities, research institutes but also smaller groups and agents – are increasingly committing themselves to managing research data sustainably and ensuring the interdisciplinary exchange of data. The initiative to establish a National Research Data Infrastructure, with the aim of reviewing the systematic planning, collection, processing, analysis, archiving, publication and exchange of data of various types to be reused by the scientific community and the general public, reflects this tremendous structural change.

The Humanities, Cultural Studies and Social Sciences in particular have been and continue to be faced with new challenges in this regard, since research data management and standardized data exchange are often less naturally integrated into their disciplinary divisions and infrastructures than in the case of the Life Sciences or Natural Sciences.

In Germany, the so-called small disciplines, which currently include more than 150 fields of study, mostly in the Humanities, Social and Cultural Sciences, find the challenges associated with these tasks particularly difficult to master. Neither the institutions nor the small disciplines are regarded as being mere sub-disciplines of a larger discipline.

The long-term funding and continued existence of these disciplines is a major objective of German higher education and research infrastructure in general. As the Federal Minister of Education and Research Anja Karliczek has emphasised: ‘The small disciplines provide valuable answers to the many important questions facing our society, not least of all what holds it together. They create significant knowledge and play a part in preserving our cultural heritage.’

However , when it comes to setting up modern research data infrastructures, the small disciplines do not have access to the resources of the institutions to which, as a rule, they are organisationally linked, or they cannot gain access to them to the extent necessary. They also lack the necessary resources and structures of their own to support the specific needs of their academic community with regard to modern research data management, to adapting existing practices to new standards and thus to implementing compatible, user-oriented concepts for the exchange, backup and reuse of data.

As the Arbeitsstelle Kleiner Fächer or Small Disciplines’ Unit of the Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) in Mainz has stated, although the majority of small disciplines belong to the Humanities and Cultural Studies, which as a whole receive less external funding than other sectors, they receive a comparatively above-average proportion of third-party funding (unlike major subjects in Cultural Studies and the Humanities). This is the case in terms of both the number of applications and the approved funds, which can be taken to indicate that the small disciplines do indeed have a high need for additional funding.

[^3]: Hoffmann, Stefanie; Haas, Katharina; Bahlmann, Katharina; Schmidt, Uwe, 2019: Report on the state of mapping the small disciplines as part of the project, ‘The exchange of experiences, networking and encouraging the visibility of the small disciplines’, esp. pp. 18–23.

At present, there is no standardised higher education policy framework for the promotion of small disciplines in Germany: some states have initiated special programmes, while others have no measures at all. The respective professional associations or foundations have provided additional funding to the small disciplines.

[^4]: See the detailed information provided by the Small Disciplines’ Unit, JGU Mainz, 2020: https://www.kleinefaecher.de/rahmenbedingungen.html (last accessed on 30.08.2020).

A further factor to be considered is the highly collaborative and transdisciplinary working practices of the small disciplines. These are being investigated in ‘The Dynamics of Small Disciplines’, a research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research that runs from November 2019 to October 2022.

[^5]: See https://www.kleinefaecher.de/kartierung/arbeitsstelle-kleine-faecher.html.

These working methods concern not only the collaborative work undertaken between several small and/or medium disciplines, but also the teaching and supervision of young researchers. Given the breadth of topics and the variety of methods, many of the research questions and topics covered in the small disciplines can often only be  adequately addressed by interdisciplinary collaboration: innovations are typically achieved through cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural work in transnational exchanges. The provision of digital networking, the exchange of research data and a powerful and user-friendly infrastructure to help realise and expand these goals in the future are thus of huge importance.

**The small disciplines: formal criteria**

In order to differentiate the small disciplines from larger departments and sub-disciplines, the Small Disciplines’ Unit at JGU Mainz has developed a number of criteria

[^6]: These criteria serve as the working basis and definition of the Small Disciplines’ Unit. See https://www.kleinefaecher.de/kartierung/was-ist-ein-kleines-fach.html.

that will be used as the basis for determining the characteristics, user profiles and specific requirements when using research data. At present, the unit encompasses 157 small disciplines and 2,311 professorships at 89 locations throughout Germany. These small disciplines fall into six disciplinary divisions : (1) the Humanities; (2) Health Sciences; (3) Engineering and Technology; (4) Art and Art History/Aesthetics ; (5) Natural Sciences, Agricultural Sciences and Geography; and (6) Law, Economics and Social Sciences. They can be further divided into 19 sections .

[^7]: See Hoffmann, Stefanie; Haas, Katharina; Bahlmann, Katharina; Schmidt, Uwe, 2019: Report on the state of mapping the small disciplines as part of the project, ‘The exchange of experiences, networking and encouraging the visibility of the small disciplines’, esp. p. 9f.

More than half of the small disciplines are fields of study in the Humanities, followed at some distance by the disciplines listed in (5) and (6).

[^8]: See Hoffmann, Stefanie; Haas, Katharina; Bahlmann, Katharina; Schmidt, Uwe, 2019: Report on the state of mapping the small disciplines as part of the project, ‘The exchange of experiences, networking and encouraging the visibility of the small disciplines’, esp. p. 18.

A decisive factor in this context is that the specific interests of many of the disciplines grouped together in the six disciplinary divisions have so far not been addressed separately, if at all, which is due, in part at least , to a relatively pronounced dynamic in the field: new small disciplines, such as Digital Humanities or Biodiversity, are becoming established, while others are losing their status as ‘small’ disciplines, either because the fields of study are growing or because they are being absorbed into larger disciplines.

For a field of study to be considered a small discipline:

- there should be no more than three tenured professorships per location, although up to two exceptions are possible nationwide. The respective discipline will have its own professorships at specific appointment grades.

- there should be separate study programmes with a degree at the end. The respective academic discipline is represented at German universities with its own study programmes (Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree, diploma, state exam).

- young academics, that is, those who have the potential to obtain a doctorate, should be selected and trained. Junior professorships, with the prospect of permanent or tenure-track positions, should be established.



**Social and communications criteria**

The small disciplines are no longer simply project-oriented but generally have an international and collaborative focus so that the thematically and structurally determined research requirements can be met. They also have a well-defined communications strategy that includes the use of appropriate types of media as well as a distinct approach for disseminating information to the general public. This includes:

- the belief in the small discipline as a subject in its own right: the professors who represent the respective branch of academic study at German universities see their fields of study as an independent subject.

- representation by a learned society: the respective branch of knowledge is represented by a national or international learned society. In exceptional cases, it may be acceptable that the field of study is recognized as an independent subject by a learned society. Crucially, this is a requirement of various institutions for access to funding and on which small disciplines are particularly dependent.

- professional journals and other forms of written communication: there should be a national or international specialist publication that represents the respective academic discipline.



**Target groups and their requirements**

The main objective of the NFDI4SD is to provide services and an infrastructure for all the small disciplines and the academic divisions and groups represented by them so that their scholars can realise their individual goals and projects through viable research data management. A service structure set up modularly according to the respective needs and requirements should be of great help. The various professional, communications and publication cultures of scholars and scientists need to be taken into account and should not be restricted by static and inflexible conditions and processes. In 2019, the sociologist Rudolf Stichweh described academic disciplines in the context of differentiation and dedifferentiation movements as highly dynamic communications systems: digitisation is thus intensifying the increasing emphasis in present-day research on project planning and a problem-centred way of working as is today’s growing demand for higher-level professional qualifications.

[^9]: See Szöllösi-Brenig, Vera: Report on the symposium, ‘Disciplines in motion – Differentiation and de-differentiation in the academic system?’, 2019, p. 2; https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/sites/default/files/downloads/2019-05%20Bericht_FÃ¤cher-in-Bewegung.pdf (last accessed on 30.08.2020).

The NFDI4SD consortium will therefore include researchers from a number of different disciplines as well as interested institutions in the development process of the new infrastructure through, among other things, social media, the development, dissemination and evaluation of questionnaires on the desired service package and the tendering and funding of pilot projects. The knowledge and experience gained will be incorporated into the structure and development process of the NFDI4SD and will be evaluated successively. The aim is to make research data reusable through a number of different action strategies in order to avoid the data being lost owing to a lack of time, expertise or financial means.

At this juncture, another feature of the NFDI4SD makes itself known: projects at different stages of development, of varying sizes and with varying funding periods are explicitly addressed, from qualification projects, such as university theses and dissertations, to larger research groups at institutions or universities.

The publication of research findings, particularly in the case of doctoral theses, has, in many disciplines, so far been the primary indicator of the success of a research project, while the underlying data were not contextualized or systematically indexed. This meant that the data could not be cited in other academic studies without first having been reworked. In more extensive interdisciplinary research projects and collaborative work, the insights and partial findings gained through communicating with others and making evaluations from a number of different perspectives are of particular importance as they facilitate the publication of research data and partial findings. As a consequence, a stronger dynamic is developed, which benefits the entire research process.

**Desiderata**

 **D1** Review the sequential planning approach, which tends to place publication at the end of a research process and thus usually beyond the funding period

**D2** Create an infrastructure for archiving and publishing the data in the long term

**D3** Integrate the research data into a network of global data resources that supplement each other

**D4** Register applicable software solutions for standard computational workflows

**D5** Integrate expertise outside academia into a data network of specialized resources

**D6** Disseminate the research findings to the general public. Develop and implement quick and stable deployment strategies

## Research Data {: .page-title}

### Epistemology of research data

Research data are not an invention of the digital age: since antiquity they have been published and used in the history of scholarship as a distinct type of information. The localities and paths of the ancient world were listed in data catalogues, such as Ptolemy’s *Geography*, and scholars determined the constellation of the stars with the help of Ptolemy’s *Handy Tables*. Early calendars and the dating of religious festivals were also based on research data, while encyclopaedias provided summaries of standardised knowledge. Extensive collections of research data created the success of modern scholarship and science in combination with the development of grand theories, although, as these collections were mostly collaborative projects, they often did not bear an author’s name. Research data are epistemically verified with the greatest of care in all academic cultures. They are bodies of knowledge that are regularly examined to identify errors as quickly as possible and to mark the validated data. Thus, research data are not simply information that is disseminated on the Internet in our digital age, linked to other data and made accessible irrespective of its truthfulness. Nor are they ‘closed data’, which, like rarefied treasures, are only accessible to the privileged few.

The concept of knowledge was introduced by scholars to classify this special status of information about society and the world. With the generic nature of theory, we can characterize research data as the description of any class of objects that qualifies as knowledge. Research data as knowledge about the properties of research objects which have been methodologically evaluated by the academic community can therefore be distinguished from arbitrary information: research data are collaboratively, openly and critically examined; they represent a claim of validity that can be revised at any time. The organisation of scholarly communication and the ethos of dealing with knowledge are optimised in order to minimise errors. These established methodological mechanisms should apply to the research data of all disciplines.

This special status of research data, together with all the academic disciplines, including in particular the so-called small disciplines, is the main focus of the NFDI4SD’s challenge of developing an appropriate research data infrastructure.

!!! note "research data"
    **RD1**: Scholars and scientists consider research data to be fallible knowledge: they can be justified and can then serve as the basis for justifying statements; they can also qualify as epistemic states. To this end, they must be computationally identifiable at all times, independently of their symbolic form. All epistemic qualifications need to be transparent.

All the additional attributes that are used to handle research data as knowledge can be synthesised. Research data can be differentiated according to the components of the data’s content, the metadata and the epistemic knowledge claims qualification. The content of research data refers to the characteristics of the research objects described by the data. Research data always include both content and its additional attributes. As a result, an infrastructure of research data must assure and maintain data integrity.

We can draw an analogy between our understanding of research data and the concept of paratext (@zotero-40395), which has been debated in the past few years: according to the philologically based concept introduced by Gérard Genette (1930–2018), paratexts are those elements that have been added to the main text of an (originally literary) work and which decisively influence and control the reception and distribution of the work. These elements include information on the author, the publisher, the title, preface, acknowledgements, advertising, and so forth. [@genette1997] The concept of paratext, which directs greater attention to production processes and to cases of authorisation, was later extended to include various types of text and new media formats. In the context of the digitisation of research data, this means that the verification, authorisation and permanent accessibility of research data will have a particularly decisive influence on the adherence and further development of national and international standards and quality requirements.

!!! note "research data"
    **RD2**: Research data are composed of content, metadata and epistemic attributes. All the information on the data sources, such as main texts and paratexts, is unified within the research data. The composition of the data needs to adhere to epistemic principles in order to enhance the way in which knowledge is obtained, accessed and maintained.

It was the physicist and philosopher Hans Reichenbach (1891–1953) who codified the distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification in connection with critically evaluating statements. The context of discovery takes into account the causes that lead to new insights being formed and the evaluation of scientific evidence. The basis for the justification of statements must be differentiated from the discovery of statements, regardless of whether they are theoretical hypotheses or the content of research data. Researchers who are looking for new answers and who create and use research data for this purpose, focus on the context of discovery. However, in doing so they overlook the fact that a discovery process is always based on knowledge that has already been justified. Research data are validated particularly carefully if they are being prepared for publication during the research process.

!!! note "research data"
    **RD3**: The value of research data must always be assessed according to how it will be reused by others and not from the perspective of the first person involved in the discovery process.

The justification of knowledge – and thus the validity of research data – is a collaborative task of the entire research community. Therefore, the research data infrastructure must provide the means to track the provenance of research data as well as the epistemic dependence on tertiary sources. This is rarely guaranteed at present.

!!! note "research data"
    **RD4**: The justification of the data by other research data should be as transparent and comprehensible as possible. A ‘dependency graph’ can show how research data is connected to other research data and thus clarify the epistemic dependencies between them. The academic assumptions that determine the validity of the research data should be clearly identifiable.

It thus follows that newly acquired data within an innovative research organisation must be made available to other academics as quickly and completely as possible if the data is to be epistemically possible. This act of transferring research data from the hands of individual researchers who are working in the context of discovery to the public has its own special term: *academic publication*.

!!! note "research data"
    **RD5**: Publication. The publishing of research data is the act of handing over compiled findings of data that were made in the discovery context to the academic community. Only then do the findings become justified knowledge. Research data is given the status of empirical findings only once they have been published. Research data publication leads to citable data sets, which are listed in the bibliographies of other authors, such as in current research literature.

The consequence is that research data publication is now being considered as early as possible in management planning. A strict sequence of processes, in which the publication of research data is planned only after the completion of a project and after all other activities have been finalised, is thus no longer logical from the point of view of academic theory; indeed, it adversely affects innovative research. The modified workflow of data publication and data citation will result in research projects gaining greater visibility, while the publication of one’s own data will significantly increase the impact of the project and the people involved in it.

!!! note "research data"
    **RD6** Citing research data. The origin of reused research data should always be cited. Research data should be cited, like any other scholarly source, in bibliographies or lists of references. The format of a data citation also resembles the reference styles of other bibliographical sources. Citations can be managed and administered in citation databases or by using citation tools.

During the course of a research project, a great deal of research data is created in relation to other data. The new data are annotated, linked or are used in other ways to further research. The scope of these research data is huge, yet currently very little of these data are published. These data sets considerably increase the usefulness of the linked data.

!!! note "research data"
    **RD7** Enhancing research data. Modern research projects create a rich and additional amount of research data during the research process.



### Institutional consequences: the use of FAIR principles

We understand the FAIR data principles to be a framework for developing an infrastructure that serves research data as a knowledge base with the purpose of creating a collaborative and open science.

In order to create the conditions for such a framework, a number of leading international research associations and institutions committed themselves to implementing the FAIR data principles. Increasingly, many funding bodies only allocate funds to projects that fulfil FAIR conditions. Today, however, these conditions cannot be guaranteed by researchers alone: research projects in the small disciplines that are managed in an agile and collaborative way in particular do not tend to have the resources to meet the special requirements of providing and using research data. A research-based infrastructure will be needed.

The FAIR principles can be interpreted in a variety of ways, but we intend to follow the proposals of the GO FAIR initiative, [^gofair]the vision of which is to foster ‘the coherent development of the global Internet of FAIR Data & Services (IFDS), with the main focus on early developments in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)’.[^gof1]

[^gofair]: [go fair](https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/)

[^gof1]: [Go fair principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

!!! note "research data"
    **RD8**: The FAIR principles (reproduced below from the GO FAIR website) regulate the technical implementation of research data. The NFDI4D will use these guidelines to implement its research data infrastructure. The guidelines are intended to ‘improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse of digital assets’:

### Findable

>The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.

>F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

>F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)

>F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

>F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource


### Accessible

>Once the user finds the required data, s/he needs to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

>A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

>A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

>A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

>A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

### Interoperable

>The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage and processing.

>I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation

>I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

>I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

### Reusable
>The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

>R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

>R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

>R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

>R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

Many of the principles mentioned above are open to a number of interpretations. As a result, no technical specifications can be deduced from these regulations. Expressions for the release of and access to data, such as ‘released’ and ‘accessible’, do not give enough information on the procedures. The NFDI4SD’s partner Zenodo, which is hosted by CERN, has developed its own ‘best effort principles’. (s) A substantial part of the publishing of small- and medium-sized research data collections is expected to be done on the Zenodo platform. Larger collections will be stored in separate data repositories. To begin with, the larger collections will carry out Zenodo’s implementation proposals.

[^s]: The goal of an open-access infrastructure is prominently formulated in Plan S[[GS1\]](#_msocom_1) and has been placed on the agenda of many European academic institutions. The findings of a self-evaluation concerning these objectives are to be published, together with the determined metrics of the research data, on a regular basis.
[^]: [[GS1\]](#_msoanchor_1)Perhaps Plan S should be explained: (which requires that scientists and researchers working for state-funded organisations publish their work in open repositories or in journals available to all by 2021).

## Paratext {: .page-title}

![](/Volumes/GGbackup/Dropbox/2020NFDI4SD/Cube/site/concept/assets/NFDI4SD_paratext.jpg)

### Metadata

Besides the content data, the paratext of research data contains different types of additional metadata. Citing the recommended metadata of the RDA,[^rda] and OpenAIRE:[^oair1]

>Metadata is data providing information about data that makes findable, trackable and (re)usable. It can include information such as contact information, geographic locations, details about units of measure, abbreviations or codes used in the dataset, instrument and protocol information, survey tool details, provenance and version information and much more.

The recommended set of paratext data will be discussed at the beginning of the NFDI4SD in workshops and expert consultations. Metadata will satisfy the required core (e.g. Dublin core,  Datacite and OpenAIRE). We, therefore, apply the proposal of [Datacite](http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.3/doc/DataCite-MetadataKernel_v4.3.pdf). We share the experience that in the important data aggregation such as the definition of metadata, standardised ontologies only play a subordinate role so far. A standardisation of terminology and meaning will still be a tightly controlled part of the data preparation process.

### Ontologien / CIDOC / Referenzdaten

NFDI4D wird ein reichhaltiges Portfolio von machinell verarbeiteten Ontologien zur Verfügung stellen (vergleichbar mit [Achres](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ontologies-in-arches/)), z.B. CRM (Conceptual Reference Model ([CIDOC](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/))). Das von NFDI4D bevorzugte bottom-up Modell der semantischen Frameworks und ihrer inferentiellen Verarbeitung sieht immer ein Prüfung ihrer Anwendungsbereiche durch die Projekt selbst vor. Die darauf aufbauenden machine learning algorithmen müssen immer ihre Qualitätsmetriken am annotierten Referenzdatenbeständen ausweisen. Diese Referenzdaten sind selbst im Idealfall publizierte, manuell von den Forschern ausgewählte und geprüfte Forschungsdaten.



Following considerations might be taken into account:

  - Paratext data will best be coded as [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) format, which as a lightweight Linked Data format allows a standardized API for complex hierarchical data structures. Its standards are ideal for an interoperable API, REST-services and Web interface.[^ld]Transformations into other formats and standards are planned.
  - Core metadata, as required by ZENODO and generic data repositories, will be included in the set of metadata.
  - Paratext will consist of the provenance of data to allow the composition of a data dependency graph. It will enable functions for the NFDI4SD registry to administer data dependencies and informative navigation through data repositories to the researcher.
  - Many data provider - e.g. Bayerischer Staatsbibiothek München - as a pivotal content provider for digital ressources, has tagged exceptionally well their more than 2.5 mio digital objects and provides various RDF and XML structured metafiles. Their schema will be transparently used for the subsequent processing of research data for our researcher. A maximum of coherence of data and metadata is intended.
  - Meaningful data APIs will be created along the lines of [API](https://rollout.io/blog/json-ld-building-meaningful-data-apis/) considerations.
  - Machine learning tools of the NFDI4SD will supply flexible mapping between user-specific terminology and data standards.
  - Sufficient documentation of data, their origin, units, explanation of terms and cross-linking to standards of definition are recommended and will be assisted by appropriate tools using research feedback from the specific research community.
  - There is a discussion about the advantage of [Structured Data Transformation (SDTL)](https://ddialliance.org/announcement/public-review-structured-data-transformation-language-sdtl) which addresses the issue of data provenance.[^sdtl1] A proposal is under review.

  # Standards and NFDI4D's *Standards-Companion*


  The proven and widely used services such as Zenodo, reference data, programming languages and ontologies already presuppose a rich set of standards and norms for the data used.


Some specific examples of metadata standards, both general and domain specific are:

- Dublin Core - domain agnostic, basic and widely used metadata standard
- DDI (Data Documentation Initiative) - common standard for social, behavioral and economic sciences, including survey data
- EML (Ecological Metadata Language) - specific for ecology disciplines
- ISO 19115 and FGDC-CSDGM (Federal Geographic Data Committee's Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata) - for describing geospatial information
- MINSEQE (MINimal information about high throughput SEQeuencing Experiments) - Genomics standard
- FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) - Astronomy digital file standard that includes structured, embedded metadata
- MIBBI - Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations
Where no appropriate, formal metadata standard exists, for internal use, writing “readme” style metadata is an appropriate strategy.
If you need more information, check the following resources:
- DCC Metadata Standards
- RDA Metadata Directory

Other standards and ontologies:

- Zenodo API
- PID systems
- JSON-LD
- UTF 8
- CIDOC[^cd]
- Schema.org

Researchers are not expected to master all these standards themselves and to be able to judge the advantages and disadvantages of other standards.

Disciplines therefore develop or use their own specific terminologies, whereby research data distributed over various contexts of origin accumulates a conceptual vagueness that creates difficulties in the uncritical use of simple terminology. Linked Open Data (LOD) should therefore go beyond the sole use of ontologies and move from the possibilities of machine learning to the tested use of vague concepts. Mees, Thiery and Unold have convincingly pointed out use cases of provincial Roman archaeology and many others no subject. [^33]

[^33]: [@unold2019]

In order to offer the development as well as the use of the rich standards to researchers as a service, NFDI4SD is developing a *Standards-Companion*. Analogous to the Companion on legal standards, NFDI4SD is developing a Standards-Companion, which classifies the registered research data with the means of machine learning on the application of standards and directly generates an automated report on the standards used, their reference pages and further literature via the virtual research bench. Alternative standard concepts are also reported. The Standards-Companion constantly updates its own database and in this way ensures the harmonisation of research data. The data sources for the Standard-Companion are in particular

- Formal models of the standards
- Labeled data for machine learning

### Provenience

Data Provenience will become part of the paratext of research data. It will be gathered by compiling a dependency graph between research data objects as described in either narrative publications or the analysis of computational notebooks. Each research data object will carry a unique identifyer and reference in research publication establish the dependencies between them. NFDI4SD registry will build up a large dependency graph for research data that will be the basis of supporting the cataloging and reuse of research data.

## Computational Notebooks {: .page-title}


The virtual working environment of NFDI4SD is realised by computational notebooks. Since 1984, Donald Knuth's paradigm of literate programming [@knuth1984a] has been based on the narrative description of algorithms as a weave or mixture of explanatory text and executable program. Literate programming environments have been developed for many languages and computational purposes, beginning with Knuth's own typesetting system.

### Jupyter notebooks

The version of the Jupyter notebooks that is widely used today was originally developed by Jernando Perez and Brian E. Granger as "An Open Source Framework for Interactive, Collaborative and Reproducible Scientific Computing and Education" and summarised their objectives in the points: [^2]


> * "Individual exploration: a single investigator tests an idea, algorithm or question, likely with a small-scale test data set or simulation.
>*  Collaboration: if the initial exploration appears promising, more often than not some kind of collaborative effort ensues.
>* Production-scale execution: large data sets and complex simulations often require the use of clusters, supercomputers or cloud resources in parallel.
>* Publication: whether as a paper or an internal report for discussion with colleagues, results need to be presented to others in a coherent form.
>* Education: ultimately, research results become part of the corpus of a discipline that is shared with students and colleagues, thus seeding the next cycle of research."

Researchers use the NFDI4SD services in the form of advanced computational notebooks. The researcher can choose from a range of different running environments of computational notebooks, which are adapted to the development. NFDI4SD develops comprehensive libraries for these environments, providing additional functionality for using research data's computational services, including

- aggregation
- data wrangling
- visualisation
- publication


NFDI4SD follows closely the technological development and intends to support the most important computational notebooks currently used by the small subjects with the support of the steering committee. The following figure shows the implementation of computational notebooks by Jupyter notebooks in the web environment of Jupyterlab [^1].

Die computational Notebooks entwickeln ihre Funktionalität und Bedienungsfreundlichkeit ständig weiter.

- Viele verschiedene vielversprechende Ansätze der kollaborativen Zusammenarbeit von Forschergruppen an einem Dokument sind bereits in fortgeschrittenem Entwicklungsstadium.
- Zukünftige Notebooks kombinieren die Vorzüge aktueller Entwicklungen von Computersprachen und gehen flexibel auf die verschiedenen Kompetenzfelder der Nutzer ein.

## Publication {: .page-title}


 Research data require a publication for their full further use by others. Thus, the medial spectrum of publication extends to research data and other media that make direct use of research data. The methodological requirements for publications such as persistent identifier, quality assurance, archiving, review, citation, author attribution or cataloguing remain the same for all publication formats. Like all forms of publication, data are linked using cross-references to other publications with full citation and comprehensive bibliographic references.

### Research data on Zenodo

 ![](/Volumes/GGbackup/Dropbox/2020NFDI4SD/Cube/site/services/assets/markdown-img-paste-20200827092932204.png)

NFDI4SD support many data preparation serves to support researchs in their publication efforts.

- Standardisation: offers transformation into equivalent formats reducing variation of terminology and nomenclature.
- Computational assistants check data integrity, completeness, consistency
- Publicaton companion as a sophisticated reviewing service to interactively prepare research data together with the paratext for submission.

 We encourage the use of a newly created *NFDI4SD Community Collections* for text and data publications. As an example: the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System supports the publication of astronomy thesis in [Zenodo's Astronomy Thesis Collection](https://zenodo.org/communities/astrothesis?page=1&size=20).


 At the same time Zenodo both allows bulk uploading and harvesting its repositories. The policy allows NFDI4SD to implement a rapid <u>open science</u> publication workflow for its research bench implementation. A curated publishing setup from the implementation of NFDI4SD provides the best of two worlds for researchers using NFDI4SD services: research data will be curated and scrutinized by NFDI4SD research data compliances. Machine learning diagnostic tools support the composition of research data before they will be submitted for publication. Enhanced research metrics will supplement the NFDI4SD registry to document, display and facilitate collaborative usage of published research data by others.

 Creation of a DOI registered data submission on Zenodo ist straightforward and well established.[^doizen]

 [^doizen]: [submitting to ZENODO](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)

### Research data publication of repositories

 NFDI4SD will be instrumental in setting up large digital repositories. Depending on the size of data and demand of overall storage capacity designed recommendations and interfaces for long term data repositories will be provided. During the pilot period all existing large data repositories will be evaluated for its suitability and a matrix of evaluation criteria will be published.

### Interactive articles

Development of interactive articles is rapid with many scholarly attributes like mathematical typsetting, tables, crossreferences, footnotes and bibliographies including extended bibliographies of published research data. NFDI4SD will adopt and develop one interactive article framework with simlar objective as [distill journal](https://distill.pub/journal/) with [distill guide](https://distill.pub/guide/). A brilliant article about advantages of interactive articles has been published by [Hohmann, Conlen, Heer and Chau.](https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/)


However, destill's authoring process has to be much simplified and  especially expandedfor integrating research data publication. We believe that interative articles are the perfect platform for documenting and explaining published datasets.

![](/Volumes/GGbackup/Dropbox/2020NFDI4SD/Cube/site/services/assets/markdown-img-paste-2020091408134547.png)


NFDI4SD will develop an much more accessible authoring system with zero-additional-skill manuscript writing and support for extending research data inclusion. It will transform the presentation of research data beyond traditional forms of documentation.

## Content Partner {: .page-title}

### Content provider

Researchers use a dense network of research data. The small subjects are dependent on research data from a wide range of disciplinary sources. NFDI4SD provides software packages for computational notebooks that can import, cite and reuse the diverse data offered by providers. The employed research data are used in data links, algorithmic derivation or combined data sets. Linked data is an essential part of the research work. In their combination, the NFDI4SD provides invaluable support for automated access to required research data.

- Data aggregation: Research objects of one species are often required on a large scale, often as representative sample data: Documents on a topic are rarely found already prepared and compiled in one data source. Even very large libraries and archives seldom maintain complete collections. Most research projects depend on their own consolidation of the research subjects and preparation of the data in suitable data formats.

Digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way researchers work, particularly in the small disciplines. These scholars are typically involved in highly collaborative and global long-term projects that use innovative technology, but they often do not have access to the research data and publication infrastructure that their home institutions usually provide to researchers. Collaborative projects require agile workflows for all user groups. Data aggregation, preparation, processing, analyses and publications are all important elements of modern scholarly research. The main purpose of the NFDI4SD consortium is to provide scholars with research-integrating data together with other scientific support. By concentrating on the small disciplines, the consortium will be able to supply researchers with the services they require on a daily basis. The first objective will be to break up the traditional, sequential way in which the research procedure is organised and weave the research data, including publication of the data, into an integrated research process, complemented by a moderated research model that incorporates research data into the ongoing research workflow (or, as we call it, the ‘cube’).

### Objectives



!!! Objective
    **O1**: Both the use and production of research data will be tightly integrated into ongoing research projects. Since antiquity, science research has been an collaborative enterprise. The NFDI4SD’s services will become an integral part of current research, initially through the NFDI4SD entering into collaboration with new research projects. These agreements will be open to all disciplines, independent of their institutional classification as ‘small disciplines’.


Currently, the main desideratum of researchers working in the small disciplines is access to modern computational research data beyond the support of their home institutions and third-party funding bodies. As science is per se a collaborative undertaking, knowledge exchange is fundamental to developing innovative and critical science. As a support infrastructure, the NFDI4SD will be a novel institutional research partner in the scientific arena.

!!! Objective
    **O2**: The NFDI4SD will develop research data services that respond directly to the feedback of research projects. For many years now, the Arbeitsstelle Kleine Fächer (Small Disciplines’ Unit) has been recording the institutional framework of the small disciplines. It enables researchers, students, institutions and, in the future, the NFDI4SD to communicate directly with one another. New concepts in the computational philosophy of science will guide the software architecture of research data flows.

Computational tools develop at a rapid pace. NFDI4D aims to use the latest of those and motivate its researcher to deploy their own for common use as quickly as possible.

!!! Objective
    **O3**: The NFDI4SD will use and develop best-practice, open-source tools and computational libraries to provide their services within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

The NFDI4SD will be an active member of the German NFDI consortium and will strive to form collaborations with other suitable consortia. It will commit itself to the strategic plans of the EOSC Roadmap and seek membership in the newly created EOSC Association. The proven infrastructure of CERN’s Zenodo platform will provide OpenAIRE data publication, data harvesting and it will adhere the FAIR data principles in order to realise the eight ambitions of Open Science.

!!! Objective
    **O4**: The signing of agreements with relevant stakeholders – libraries, archives and other content providers – on standards, application programming interfaces (APIs) and open access via computer networks.

The NFDI4SD governing body will seek to enter into operational agreements with a several content-providing institutions on the implementation and accessibility of APIs for the NFDI4SD’s infrastructure hub. These agreements, using widely accepted standards, will enable researchers to access large sets of research data from a large number of content-holding institutions. It is expected that, within a short space of time, the NFDI4SD will be able to provide standardised API and interface modules. The large variety of small disciplines involved will ensure that special collections beyond the significant stakeholders will be included in this integrated network of content providers.

!!! Objective
    **O5**: The NFDI4SD aims to maximise the visibility of the impact of research

New generation metrics monitors will be implemented to monitor the use and impact of the NFDI4SD’s services as part of the support offered to research projects. Daily, updated monitors and impact indicators will enable researchers to assess their collaborative global network as well as to inform the NFDI4SD’s governing body of hotspots of usage and of the need to steer users towards a particular course of action.



!!! Objective
    **O6**: Publication and science outreach

All output for general scholarly use will be regarded as publishable material. Such material goes beyond putting data on a file server: publications adhere to FAIR data principles and use review, curation and scholarly assessments. The NFDI4SD intends to establish new procedures and references for data publications so as to significantly enhance the impact of research.


### Task areas

The nature, benefits and characteristics of research data are surprisingly complex: data exist in many different media formats and contribute to the information value of the subject areas of research, while researchers benefit from the speedy dissemination of their publications and research findings, which leads to rapid knowledge exchange. A Research Management Plan will coordinate the use and interoperability of the NFDI4SD’s services. Internal and external forms of communicating for research purposes, data storage, usage and revision as well as full-page archiving, including the publication of the research findings and research data, will all form part of the NFDI4SD’s services.

The workflow of research activities in the context of highly collaborative, agile scientific communities occurs at the interplay between data and theory, using – among other things – computational means. Such activities can neither be ordered as a linear sequence of tasks, nor as a research data life cycle. The organisation of the workflow of research activities has been designed using Thomas Kuhn’s metaphor of science as a puzzle-solving activity. We describe the pipeline of scientific processes as the transformation of input data via research pipes into designed outcomes. This operational sequence can be compared to the rotations of a multidimensional research cube (solving Rubik’s cube, for example). The cube’s faces represent the content, data, skills, or means of the research activities. Each single step (that is, each rotation of the cube) leads to a new configuration.

This puzzle-solving metaphor facilitates the orchestration of the NFDI4SD’s services into research activities by organising and communicating the growing repertoire of the NFDI4SD’s numerous research data services. The cube describes the requirements, standards and quality of data as well as the information, metadata and documentation they contain, in order to assure the best usage of services. The NFDI4SD is basing its operation on a wide spectrum of standards, API norms, data formats as recommended by the EOSC and other standard institutions. The NFDI4SD will rapidly develop a user-friendly service catalogue that will serve as a graphical user interface (GUI) for researchers, who will be able to choose their needed service, quickly apply it to their given data and research questions and then obtain their findings.

!!! Task_area
    **TA1**: research

The aim of this large task area is to observe at close range the application of the NFDI4SD’s services and then to recommend the development of additional services to satisfy the demands of the various disciplines. TA1 will be supported by a broad range of fields, assisted by coordinators.

!!! Task_area
    **TA2**: operational services

This operational task area is to develop and secure the running of the NFDI4SD’s infrastructure, using Zenodo, Europe’s renowned research data publishing platform.

!!! Task_area
    **TA3**: collaboration

There is a rising demand for cloud collaboration services among today’s research environments. The direct exchange of information is being replaced by the publication of texts and data, with user interfaces ensuring that scholars and scientists can use and control data effectively, without having to undergo any special training. In addition, metadata as well as knowledge graphs, advanced catalogues and reference tools will enable users of the NFDI4SD’s services to make the most of open scientific data.

!!! Task_area
    **TA4**: standards and quality assessment

Data encoding, flow computers, computer interfaces, APIs and publications require widely applicable standards, norms and metadata. Our principal investigators (PIs) are long-term members of the key standardisation committees and so will ensure the interoperability of the research data over a long period of time.

!!! Task_area
    **TA5**: governance and communication

The highly experienced and international scientific representatives responsible for this TA will ensure that there is an effective information flow and that negotiations and agreements with research institutions around the world proceed smoothly. Virtual conferences, newsletters, blogs and, hopefully, physical meetings in the not-to-distant future should promote productive and effective science communication, including the transmission of science findings to the general public.

!!! Task_area
    **TA6**: legal aspects

Intense scientific collaborative work and the exchange of information, including the publication of data, involve complex legal considerations. This area will be tasked with preparing the operating rules, virtual information desks and consultation services. It will also actively shape the future legal landscape of the research process in the digital age.

## Measures and Workpackages {: .page-title}

## Work program

### Terminology

DFG proposed using the following terminology, services and work programme:

> **Services:** In describing the services to be provided by the consortium, distinguish clearly between services that consortium members will provide as part of their institutional mission (Grundaufgaben) based on existing funding, and new services that will be established within the NFDI framework (and for which funding can be requested within the NFDI).

> **Work Program:** This section describes the structure of your work programme as it relates to the specific **aims** and **objectives** of the proposed consortium, particularly to your research data management strategy. Major achievements to be attained during the course of the work programme, such as community-wide standards, can be defined as **milestones.** Tangible results, such as defined services, can be categorised as **deliverables.**

> The work programme of a consortium is divided into **task areas**, which may consist of different **measures.** Please provide **tabular overviews** of the envisaged task areas, the proposed **measures per task area**, and the **individual(s) responsible for a given task area (co- spokespersons)**. Provide a detailed description of the measures to be addressed in the task area and explain how they relate to your specific objectives. Explain the contribution of the consortium members and/or participants who will be involved in the individual measures.

> **Mark task areas that are relevant to other NFDI consortia** or will be applied for within other consortia accordingly and explain the relation (e.g. by using footnotes or text below the table).

> The coordination and **administrative tasks for the consortium as a whole** must be included in a separate task area –usually the concluding one. Note that applicants may request funds to coordinate activities or work with other consortia. "Provide a detailed description of the measures to be addressed in the task area and explain how they relate to your specific objectives. It may be helpful to work with or develop use cases to illustrate your approach. Which aspects of your research data management strategy will be addressed by this task area? Explain the contribution of the consortium members and/or participants who will be involved in the individual measures. How will this task area cooperate with other task areas (include cross-area dependencies where applicable)? Address possible risks of implementation."

NFDI4SD zielt darauf ab, von der großen Nutzergruppe der Forscher der Kleinen Fächer wie auch andere  Interessierte auf ihre Bedürfnisse an Leistungen der Forschungsdateninfrastruktur hingewiesen zu werden. Mit Beginn der Arbeiten wird das NFDI4SD

### Forscher laufend informieren

- alle Forscher und Projektmitglieder kontaktieren

- über die Serviceangebot informieren

- in Medien, Blogs und sozialen Medien über die Angebote orientieren

- abonnierte News Dienste einrichten

### Über Forschungsdaten informieren

Die Forschungsdaten werden maximal sichtbar katalogisiert und seine Metadaten in die relevanten Dienste integrieren. Größere Repositorien, institutionelle Repositorien oder historisch gewachsene Datenbestände werden von eigenen IT-Einrichtungen betrieben und über API in die Forschungsdatenschnittstellen des NFDI4SD eingebunden. Dazu werden mit den Institutionen geeignete Abkommen abgeschlossen.

### NFDI4SD general repository

Das NFDI4SD verwendet community Ressourcen und schlägt die Nutzung von ZENODO als Publikationsplattform für Communities als eine der präferierten Plattformen als general repository für kleinen bis mittlere Datenbestände vor. Diese werden insbesondere für die sekundären Forschungsdaten besonders relevant.

### Comparison of general research data repositories

> The General Repository Comparison Chart and FAIRsharing Collection (https://fairsharing.org/collection/GeneralRepositoryComparison) is an outcome of the NIH Workshop on the Role of Generalist Repositories to Enhance Data Discoverability and Reuse held 11-12 February 2020 (workshop summary).  Following the workshop, representatives of the participating generalist repositories collaborated to develop a tool researchers could use to make decisions about selecting a general repository. We intend for the content to be dynamically updated through our partnership with FAIRsharing.  As we work towards that goal, we currently have a static version of the comparison.[^rda1]

## Epistemology of research data

The epistemological network of the NFDI4SD will be a novelty. Research data are usually published in logical isolation and, if necessary, searched through cataloguing categories. In the visualisation, different objects of research data are classified by category in a thematic cube. The registry of the NFDI4SD enhances browsing in research data catalogues. It uses machine learning methods to create relationships between the data: Provenance or inferential relationships. These networks are created for all catalogued research data, not only those for which researchers have used the services of the NFDI.Similar to citation graphs of citations between publications, all accessible publications of research data are referentially linked with machine learning tools.


Deep learning models reveal the content and classify the research data on which the argumentation of the publications is epistemically based.These searches are initially prepared for the small subjects and can offer very substantial and specific support for the research projects.  The registry of the NFDI4SD creates a special **epistemic knowledge graph** for the most diverse contexts of research data:

### Impact Analysen

Usage relationships between research data show the wide range of uses. In the following diagram, the usage strands are represented by different widths of the zones.

## Consortium


![NFDI4SD](/Volumes/GGbackup/Dropbox/2020NFDI4SD/Cube/site/governance/assets/NFDI4SD.png "Consortium")

All spokespeople are members of the **steering committee** which regularly  reviews and decides per majority
- timeline of workpackages
- major working contracts
- user feedback and requests
- evaluation of performance metrics
- new members, partners, advisors, workshops and conferences
- spokespeople responsible for TAs and working packages report to the steering committee and place their proposal for consideration
- decide about annual budget
- The two spokespeople are responsible for the daily administrative decisions on issues which are defined by the **steering committee** at the inauguration of the NFDI4SD.

**task areas** have responsible spokespeople confirmed and assigned by the steering committee. Their goals and milestones are defined in the **table of tasks** submitted with the NFDI4SD proposal. Its composition will be reviewed and decided on by the **steering committee** annually, if needed on shorter notice.

A **scientific advisory board** will be elected with the inauguration of the NFDI4SD by the **steering committee**. It will advice the steering committee on requests and report to the body regularly.

The applicant institution is legaly responsible to the DFG. Budgets for staff employed by co-applicant institutions are transfered according to DFG procedures.

**Partner institutions** and **content provider** may signed contracts or letter of understanding for services for NFDI4SD such as access regulations and usage permits. These contracts are prepared by TA5 and administered by the applicatant instituion.

A **pilot period** from January 2021 until a project inauguration time will conduct workshops, review potential staff and organize meetings of the steering committee to consider recommendations for the inauguration meeting. External experts and advisors can be consulted for reviewing the working plan up to the inauguration of the NFDI4SD. Additional funding might support preparatory studies and developments.
