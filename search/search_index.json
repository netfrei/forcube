Rubik's cube is a paradigm for puzzle solving. Workflows with research data as synthesis of content and its paratext are best narrated by puzzling with \"cubes\" instead of \"research data lifecycles\". Aspects of research data like their metadata, provenience, or linked data, are panels of the cube's sides. Rotations of the cube's arrangements of planes describe activities or NFDI4SD services with data. The ultimate goal is the publication of research data: when all panels on one side match, research data are open to the community for reuse. The task The NFDI4SD consortium has the potential to solve a serious problem in the current state of research in the so-called small disciplines. The latter have achieved much in terms of the social and academic significance of the disciplines\u2019 findings: small disciplines number highly in the DFG's GEPRIS database, while the number of publications in these subject areas is considerable. The data, digitised findings and digital repositories that have been acquired through the research process are also impressive. However, there is a notable lack of secondary research data, that is, data from digital sources, the research findings derived from them and the data generated specifically for research purposes; the volume of FAIR-published secondary research data is negligible in relation to the track record of the small disciplines. This contrasts starkly with the enormous importance of the small disciplines. It is these data that make it possible for researchers to access other data and repositories. Secondary data are the real engine of future digitisation. They connect the data of different collections and combine the data in meaningful ways. Researchers cannot be held responsible for this state of affairs. Rather, it is the absence of an adequate research data infrastructure that is to blame. To help avoid these negative consequences we propose the following infrastructure for the NFDI4SD: The NFDI4SD will integrate its numerous research data services into ongoing research projects, which will come into effect in the early stages of a project. The NFDI4SD\u2019s services will become part of the research workflow and will not just be used for administrative and documentation purposes. Research data basically consists of its content (the actual data) and its paratext. APIs and other computational operations always refer to these entities of research data. The researchers will systematically guide the development of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services according to their needs and practices through their close involvement in the research projects. The NFDI4SD aims to publish the research data and intends that the data will be reused following FAIR principles by the academic community. Data will be published according to tried-and-tested scholarly and scientific publishing conventions. Computations will be part of the work process. They will be organised on the basis of \u2018computational notebooks\u2019, which are based on the concept of \u2018scientific literacy\u2019: the notebooks can be run like computer programs and they will at the same time document in detail, by means of research data, the various work procedures - and so make them understandable to other researchers. Although the infrastructure of the NFDI4SD is conceptually oriented towards the research activities of the small disciplines, thanks to its services it is open to any scholarly or scientific project, regardless of its disciplinary affiliation. Research groups or projects in the small disciplines will need to register their infrastructure service needs as early as possible (ideally before the start of a project) and coordinate the required services with the NFDI4SD. This will enable the consortium to play a constructive role in the research process by supporting the generation, systematisation, processing and evaluation of the research data right up to data publication and the subsequent reuse of the data. The NFDI4SD uses modern computational tools to make research data usable: the data become \u2018computational objects\u2019 and thus lay the groundwork for making previously unavailable research accessible. The NFDI4SD has thus introduced a new research concept, albeit one that is not primarily concerned with technical aspects and requirements. We need to look at research data in a new operational way. The research data combine (1) the content of the data (text, images, 3D objects, databases, programs) and (2) the data\u2019s paratext, that is, information on the contextual environment of the research data (such as metadata or information on the data\u2019s provenance). This bundle of properties and information defines the research data that is generated, published and reused in the research process. The procedure derived from this process will enable all the internal and external participants of the research data infrastructure to collaborate fruitfully within their respective task areas (TAs). The research data will be imported during the project funding stage and then be processed further, finally being published (as \u2018computational notebooks\u2019, for instance) as quickly and sustainably as possible. The registration of the NFDI4SD\u2019s research data will enable us to achieve another important objective: the proposed workflow will make the interdependence of the research data transparent. Which research data will be used in the calculations of other data? Scholars, scientists (hereafter also referred to as agents or researchers) or other users will thus be able to recognise the critical dependencies of their own data and will therefore be able to assess more effectively the scope of the research data in the light of a dynamically changing research landscape. The terminology (that is, the technical language, the disciplinary categorisations or conventions) that relates to the research objects will be largely developed by the project members from the language used in their disciplines and will be standardised by communicating with each specific community. In most cases, the research projects will already have an appropriate nomenclature in place, which will be used by the NFDI4SD to prepare all the data. The members of each additional research project will contribute to building a network of semantically related research terminology. With the help of this terminology, the research data will describe the properties of the group of objects under investigation and the data will therefore become the empirical basis for the evaluation of general findings. The NFDI4SD\u2019s services aim to be easy to understand and user friendly. Once registered, all researchers will receive authorisation to access the NFDI4SD\u2019s cloud services. Researchers of all qualification levels and group sizes will control the requirements of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services through the needs of their research projects. A group of co-spokespeople from task area one \u2013 TA1 (research fields) \u2013 will mediate and monitor the coordination process and will introduce the interests of the researchers to the NFDI4SD\u2019s steering committee. As demand grows and the research fields increasingly differentiate, membership of the group of co-spokespeople is likely to be extended. It will be possible to access NFDI4SD\u2019s services from, for example, the working environment of a \u2018computational notebook\u2019. Simply by inserting an additional line into the notebook, the functions can be switched from a local installation to the use of NFDI4SD\u2019s cloud services. TA2 will develop the resources for the NFDI4SD\u2019s cloud service, in particular the innovative components of machine learning and big data. TA3 will develop and operate all the services and offers that are needed to promote the visibility of collaborations and the reuse of the research data. The publication of research data is as much a part of this field of activity as are further education and training. TA4 The collaborative reuse of data will be based on normative data and standards. Usage metrics and ongoing quality assessment of the NFDI4SD will provide immediate feedback, which can be used to improve future research needs. TA5 This task area is a vital interface for the institutional partners, the external data sources and the research repositories. It will draw up the licence agreements with the partners and will also coordinate the dissemination of the publications and the NFDI4SD\u2019s services to the academic community and to the interested but non-technical general public. TA6 Every publication and every reuse of research data is protected by copyright. Researchers should, from the start of a project, be aware of and comply with copyright issues; NFDI4SD's deep learning-based virtual assistants will provide support in this area. This task area will ensure that researchers know and follow the legal requirements in good time as well as help them submit proposals for the benefit of researchers and science in general. Benefits Research Conceptually, we will use research data in an entirely new way. Not unlike the process of transforming a manuscript into a book, the NFDI4SD will turn computational content into academically usable research data. Researchers will be able to publish their key findings and introduce them to the community while they are still conducting their research: the findings will be immediately documented and they can then be incorporated into the researchers\u2019 own work as well as into the main project. The NFDI4SD consortium will ensure that valuable research findings are preserved and remain accessible in the long term without any additional effort or infrastructure costs. Young scholars and scientists The NFDI4SD will support budding academics from the very beginning of their research and will free them from any additional expenses. While a dissertation is being written up, young scholars and scientists will be able to compile simultaneously any essential research data in a format that will enable the data to be cited in a paper or a data collection and, after it has been successfully completed, published as research data together with the dissertation. This will considerably increase the scientific impact of the research work. Content providers, libraries, archives and repositories The digital resources of libraries, archives, repositories and research institutes that are now accessible have opened up a substantial part of our cultural heritage. These sources should not only be passively appreciated. According to the NFDI4SD\u2019s new concept, the content of these sources has become research data that can be directly incorporated into the research process with very little effort. The author and funding institution details are entered into the paratext database, and, because it is fully integrated, the content of the research data can also be included in all future research data. The value of the research data of these institutions will also be enhanced by the subsequent publication of the data. Small and specialized collections, in particular, are becoming more important as they are now being integrated into every data collection. Future researchers will be able to use the digital collections of other research institutions to expand their empirical base. The latest machine-learning techniques and global connectivity will enhance the effectiveness of all digitised content, which will enable researchers to access their own data stores without having to finance it. Community Unpublished research data that was previously lost after the completion of a project will now be made available. Research data used to be understood as the material commonly accepted as necessary in the scientific community to validate the resulting research findings of a scientific investigation; once the studies had been published, though, there was no infrastructure to make the data usable or to present them as independent research findings. Now, however, it will be possible to publish independently the research data of all subject areas, but especially those of the small disciplines. We should therefore see a rise in the quality and relevance of special research areas in academia generally. Funding institution The findings of funded projects will be able to reach the academic community more swiftly; this will help the actors to identify new trends as quickly as possible and to establish the needs of newly oriented research fields. The value of research funding is greatly enhanced thanks to the support provided by the research data infrastructure. Previously unused resources of research data will be made accessible with little additional effort and they will significantly increase the value of the existing data that is to be reused. The NFDI4SD addresses the European Union's growing concern about the loss of 'digital sovereignty'. The small disciplines, in particular, explore the many different dimensions of our cultural heritage: from languages, culture, history and the sciences to our political and social identity, they increase our understanding of our culture. By publishing research data, the NFDI4SD will store and link the network of our cultural heritage and contribute to making it autonomous, open access and reusable. Maintaining digital sovereignty is a vital feature of the design of the NFDI4SD's infrastructure.","title":"NFDI4SD"},{"location":"#nfdi-4-small-disciplines-nfdi4sd","text":"Draft proposal for the establishment of a National Research Data Infrastructure for Small Disciplines import {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\"; import define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/@openscience/rubiks-cube-jt.js?v=3\"; const inspect = Inspector.into(\"#observablehq-990808d3\"); (new Runtime).module(define, name => name === \"renderer\" ? inspect() : undefined); Thomas Kuhn created the metaphor of research as puzzle solving.

These scholars are typically involved in highly collaborative and global long-term projects which use innovative technology, but they often lack the research data and publication infrastructure normally provided by their home institutions. Collaborative projects require agile workflows for all user groups. Data aggregation, preparation, processing, analyses and publications are elements of modern scholarly research. The aim of the NFDI4SD consortium is to provide scholars with research-integrating data along with other scientific activities. By concentrating on the small disciplines, the consortium will be able to provide researchers with the services that they require on a daily basis. The first objective will be to break up the traditional sequential research organization and weave research data, including the publication of the data, into an integrated research process, complemented by a moderated research model that weaves research data into the ongoing research workflow (the \u201ccube\u201d). Objectives Objective O1 : Both the use and production of research data will be tightly integrated into ongoing research projects. From the beginning of science research has been an collaborative enterprise. NFDI4SD services will become integral part of current research via an initial collaborative agreement between new research projects and the NFDI4SD. These agreements will be open to all disciplines, independent of their institutional classification as \u201csmall disciplines\u201d. Currently, the main desideratum of researchers working in the small disciplines is access to modern computational research data beyond the support of their home institutions and third-party funding bodies. As science is per se a collaborative undertaking, the open knowledge exchange is fundamental to innovative and critical science. As a supporting infrastructure, the NFDI4SD will be a novel institutional research partner in the scientific arena. Objective O2 : The NFDI4SD will develop research data services that respond directly to the feedback of research projects. For many years now, the Arbeitsstelle Kleine F\u00e4cher has been recording the institutional settings of small disciplines. It enables direct communication between researchers, students, institutions and, in the future, the NFDI4SD. Modern concepts of computational philosophy of science will guide the software architecture of computational research data flows. Objective O3 : The NFDI4SD will use and supplement best-practice open source tools and computational libraries for services within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The NFDI4SD will be an active member of the German NFDI consortium and will strive to form collaborations with other suitable consortia. It will commit itself to the strategic plans of the EOSC Roadmap and seek membership in the newly created EOSC Association. The proven infrastructure of CERN\u2019s Zenodo service will provide OpenAIRE data publication, data harvesting and the implementation of FAIR data principles to implement the eight ambitions of Open Science. Objective O4 : The signing of agreements with relevant stakeholders \u2013 libraries, archives and other content providers \u2013 on standards, application programming interfaces (APIs) and open access via computer networks. The NFDI4SD governing body will seek to make operational agreements with a number of content-providing institutions on the implementation and accessibility of APIs for the NFDI4SD\u2019s infrastructure hub. These agreements, using widely accepted standards, will enable researchers to access large sets of research data from a large number of content-holding institutions. It is expected that, within a short space of time, the NFDI4SD will be able to provide standardized API and interface modules. The large variety of small disciplines involved will ensure that special collections beyond the major stakeholders will be included in this integrated network of content providers. Objective O5 : The NFDI4SD aims to maximize the visibility of the impact of research New generation metrics monitors will be implemented to monitor the use and impact of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services as part of the consortium\u2019s support of the research projects. Daily updated monitors and impact indicators will enable researchers to assess their collaborative global network as well as inform the NFDI4SD\u2019s governing body of hotspots of usage and of the need to steer users towards a particular course of action. Objective O6 : Publication and citizen science All scientific output for general scholarly use will be regarded as published material. Such material goes beyond putting data on a file server: publications implement FAIR data principles and use review, curation and scholarly assessments. The NFDI4SD intends to establish new procedures and references for data publications in order to enhance to a significant degree the impact of research. Task areas The nature, benefits and characteristics of research data are surprisingly complex: data exist in many different media formats and contribute to the information value of the subjects of research; and researchers benefit from the rapid exchange of their publications and research findings. A Research Management Plan will coordinate the use and interoperability of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services. Internal and external forms of communicating for research purposes, data storage, usage and revision as well as full-page archiving, including the final publication of research results and research data, will all form part of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services. The workflow of research activities in the context of highly collaborative, agile scientific communities occurs at the interplay between data and theory, using \u2013 among other things \u2013 computational means. Such activities can neither be ordered as a linear sequence of tasks, nor as a research data life cycle. The organization of the workflow of research activities has been designed using Thomas Kuhn\u2019s metaphor of science as a puzzle-solving activity. We describe the pipeline of scientific processes as the transformation of input data via research pipes into designed outcomes. This sequence of operation can be compared to the rotations of a multidimensional research cube (solving Rubik\u2019s cube, for example). The cube\u2019s faces represent the content, data, skills, or means of the research activities. Each single step (aka cube\u2019s rotation leads to a new configuration). This puzzle-solving metaphor facilitates the orchestration of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services into research activities by organizing and communicating the growing repertoire of the NFDI4SD\u2019s manifold of research data services. The cube describes the requirements, standards and quality of data, as well as their information, metadata and documentation, in order to assure the best usage of services. The NFDI4SD can confidently base its operation on a wide spectrum of standards, API norms, data formats as recommended by the European Open Science Cloud and other standard institutions. The NFDI4SD will rapidly develop a user-friendly service catalogue which will serve as a graphical user interface (GUI) for researchers, who will be able to choose their needed service, quickly apply it to their given data and research questions and obtain their intended results. Task_area TA1 : research fields The aim of this large task area is to observe at close range the application of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services and then to recommend the development of additional services to satisfy the demands from the various disciplines. TA1 will be supported by a broad range of fields, assisted by coordinators. Task_area TA2 : services, machine learning, big data and data connectivity The operational task area develops and secures the operation of the NFDI4SD\u2019s infrastructure. Using ZENODO utilizes Europe\u2019s largest and renowned research data publication platform and its comprehensive computer power. Task_area TA3 : collaboration tools, user interfaces and publications Today\u2019s research environments are leading to a rising demand for cloud collaboration services. Direct exchange is being replaced by the publication of texts and data. User interfaces ensure that scholars and scientists can effectively use and control data without any special training. In addition, metadata as well as knowledge graphs, advanced catalogues and reference tools will enable users of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services to make the most of open scientific data. Task_area TA4 : standards, metadata and quality assessment Data encoding, flow computers, computer interfaces, APIs and publications require the widest applicable standards, norms and metadata. Our principal investigators (PIs) are long-term members of the key standardization committees and so will ensure the interoperability of the research data over a long period of time. Task_area TA5 : institutions, governance, public outreach, media and literacy The highly experienced and international scientific representatives responsible for this TA will ensure optimal information flow and the smooth undertaking of negotiations and agreements with research institutions worldwide. The organization of virtual conferences, newsletters, blogs, and hopefully of physical meetings in the future, should ensure productive and effective scientific communication and present the research results to the general public. Task_area TA6 : legal aspects Intense scientific collaborative work and the exchange of information, including the production of publications, involve complex legal considerations.

These scholars are typically involved in highly collaborative and global long-term projects which use innovative technology, but they often lack the research data and publication infrastructure normally provided by their home institutions. Collaborative projects require agile workflows for all user groups. Data aggregation, preparation, processing, analyses and publications are elements of modern scholarly research. The aim of the NFDI4SD consortium is to provide scholars with research-integrating data along with other scientific activities. By concentrating on the small disciplines, the consortium will be able to provide researchers with the services that they require on a daily basis. The first objective will be to break up the traditional sequential research organization and weave research data, including the publication of the data, into an integrated research process, complemented by a moderated research model that weaves research data into the ongoing research workflow (the \u201ccube\u201d).","title":"Main objectives and task areas"},{"location":"concept/ObjectiveTask/#objectives","text":"Objective O1 : Both the use and production of research data will be tightly integrated into ongoing research projects. From the beginning of science research has been an collaborative enterprise. NFDI4SD services will become integral part of current research via an initial collaborative agreement between new research projects and the NFDI4SD. These agreements will be open to all disciplines, independent of their institutional classification as \u201csmall disciplines\u201d. Currently, the main desideratum of researchers working in the small disciplines is access to modern computational research data beyond the support of their home institutions and third-party funding bodies. As science is per se a collaborative undertaking, the open knowledge exchange is fundamental to innovative and critical science. As a supporting infrastructure, the NFDI4SD will be a novel institutional research partner in the scientific arena. Objective O2 : The NFDI4SD will develop research data services that respond directly to the feedback of research projects. For many years now, the Arbeitsstelle Kleine F\u00e4cher has been recording the institutional settings of small disciplines. It enables direct communication between researchers, students, institutions and, in the future, the NFDI4SD. Modern concepts of computational philosophy of science will guide the software architecture of computational research data flows. Objective O3 : The NFDI4SD will use and supplement best-practice open source tools and computational libraries for services within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The NFDI4SD will be an active member of the German NFDI consortium and will strive to form collaborations with other suitable consortia. It will commit itself to the strategic plans of the EOSC Roadmap and seek membership in the newly created EOSC Association. The proven infrastructure of CERN\u2019s Zenodo service will provide OpenAIRE data publication, data harvesting and the implementation of FAIR data principles to implement the eight ambitions of Open Science. Objective O4 : The signing of agreements with relevant stakeholders \u2013 libraries, archives and other content providers \u2013 on standards, application programming interfaces (APIs) and open access via computer networks. The NFDI4SD governing body will seek to make operational agreements with a number of content-providing institutions on the implementation and accessibility of APIs for the NFDI4SD\u2019s infrastructure hub. These agreements, using widely accepted standards, will enable researchers to access large sets of research data from a large number of content-holding institutions. It is expected that, within a short space of time, the NFDI4SD will be able to provide standardized API and interface modules. The large variety of small disciplines involved will ensure that special collections beyond the major stakeholders will be included in this integrated network of content providers. Objective O5 : The NFDI4SD aims to maximize the visibility of the impact of research New generation metrics monitors will be implemented to monitor the use and impact of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services as part of the consortium\u2019s support of the research projects. Daily updated monitors and impact indicators will enable researchers to assess their collaborative global network as well as inform the NFDI4SD\u2019s governing body of hotspots of usage and of the need to steer users towards a particular course of action. Objective O6 : Publication and citizen science All scientific output for general scholarly use will be regarded as published material. Such material goes beyond putting data on a file server: publications implement FAIR data principles and use review, curation and scholarly assessments. The NFDI4SD intends to establish new procedures and references for data publications in order to enhance to a significant degree the impact of research.","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"concept/ObjectiveTask/#task-areas","text":"The nature, benefits and characteristics of research data are surprisingly complex: data exist in many different media formats and contribute to the information value of the subjects of research; and researchers benefit from the rapid exchange of their publications and research findings. A Research Management Plan will coordinate the use and interoperability of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services. Internal and external forms of communicating for research purposes, data storage, usage and revision as well as full-page archiving, including the final publication of research results and research data, will all form part of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services. The workflow of research activities in the context of highly collaborative, agile scientific communities occurs at the interplay between data and theory, using \u2013 among other things \u2013 computational means. Such activities can neither be ordered as a linear sequence of tasks, nor as a research data life cycle. The organization of the workflow of research activities has been designed using Thomas Kuhn\u2019s metaphor of science as a puzzle-solving activity. We describe the pipeline of scientific processes as the transformation of input data via research pipes into designed outcomes. This sequence of operation can be compared to the rotations of a multidimensional research cube (solving Rubik\u2019s cube, for example). The cube\u2019s faces represent the content, data, skills, or means of the research activities. Each single step (aka cube\u2019s rotation leads to a new configuration). This puzzle-solving metaphor facilitates the orchestration of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services into research activities by organizing and communicating the growing repertoire of the NFDI4SD\u2019s manifold of research data services. The cube describes the requirements, standards and quality of data, as well as their information, metadata and documentation, in order to assure the best usage of services. The NFDI4SD can confidently base its operation on a wide spectrum of standards, API norms, data formats as recommended by the European Open Science Cloud and other standard institutions. The NFDI4SD will rapidly develop a user-friendly service catalogue which will serve as a graphical user interface (GUI) for researchers, who will be able to choose their needed service, quickly apply it to their given data and research questions and obtain their intended results. Task_area TA1 : research fields The aim of this large task area is to observe at close range the application of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services and then to recommend the development of additional services to satisfy the demands from the various disciplines. TA1 will be supported by a broad range of fields, assisted by coordinators. Task_area TA2 : services, machine learning, big data and data connectivity The operational task area develops and secures the operation of the NFDI4SD\u2019s infrastructure. Using ZENODO utilizes Europe\u2019s largest and renowned research data publication platform and its comprehensive computer power. Task_area TA3 : collaboration tools, user interfaces and publications Today\u2019s research environments are leading to a rising demand for cloud collaboration services. Direct exchange is being replaced by the publication of texts and data. User interfaces ensure that scholars and scientists can effectively use and control data without any special training. In addition, metadata as well as knowledge graphs, advanced catalogues and reference tools will enable users of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services to make the most of open scientific data. Task_area TA4 : standards, metadata and quality assessment Data encoding, flow computers, computer interfaces, APIs and publications require the widest applicable standards, norms and metadata. Our principal investigators (PIs) are long-term members of the key standardization committees and so will ensure the interoperability of the research data over a long period of time. Task_area TA5 : institutions, governance, public outreach, media and literacy The highly experienced and international scientific representatives responsible for this TA will ensure optimal information flow and the smooth undertaking of negotiations and agreements with research institutions worldwide. The organization of virtual conferences, newsletters, blogs, and hopefully of physical meetings in the future, should ensure productive and effective scientific communication and present the research results to the general public. Task_area TA6 : legal aspects Intense scientific collaborative work and the exchange of information, including the production of publications, involve complex legal considerations. This area will be tasked with preparing the operating rules, information desks and consultation services. It will also actively shape the future legal landscape of the research activities of the digital transformation that we are currently undergoing.","title":"Task areas"},{"location":"concept/means/","text":"Work program Terminology DFG proposed using the following terminology, services and work programme: Services: In describing the services to be provided by the consortium, distinguish clearly between services that consortium members will provide as part of their institutional mission (Grundaufgaben) based on existing funding, and new services that will be established within the NFDI framework (and for which funding can be requested within the NFDI).

Sie sind damit keine Erfindung des digitalen Zeitalters. Datenkataloge wie Ptolemy\u2019s Geography haben die Orte und Wege der antiken Welt geordnet, und mithilfe seiner Handy Tables bestimmten Gelehrte die Konstellation der Gestirne. Auch Kalender und damit verbundene religi\u00f6se Feste orientierten sich an Forschungsdaten, und Lexika normierten nicht zuletzt das Fachverst\u00e4ndnis und die Kommunikation von Wissen. Umfangreiche Sammlungen von Forschungsdaten schufen den Erfolg der Wissenschaft im engen Zusammenspiel mit der Entwicklung gro\u00dfer Theorien \u2013 doch sie trugen als kollaborative Gemeinschaftswerke h\u00e4ufig keinen Autorennamen. Forschungsdaten werden in allen Wissenschaftskulturen mit gr\u00f6\u00dfter Sorgfalt epistemisch gepr\u00fcft. Es sind Wissensbest\u00e4nde, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig untersucht werden, um Irrt\u00fcmer m\u00f6glichst schnell zu identifizieren und validierte Daten auszuzeichnen. Forschungsdaten sind demnach nicht einfach Informationen, die im digitalen Zeitalter im Internet verbreitet, mit anderen Daten verlinkt und offen zug\u00e4nglich ohne Ansehen ihres Wahrheitsgehalts weiter genutzt werden. Es handelt sich auch nicht um \u201cclosed data\u201d, die wie ein esoterischer Schatz nur auf Basis von Privilegien zug\u00e4nglich sind. Die Wissenschaft hat den Begriff des Wissens eingef\u00fchrt, um diesen besonderen Status von Informationen \u00fcber Gesellschaft und Welt zu kennzeichnen. Mit wissenschaftstheoretischer Allgemeinheit k\u00f6nnen wir Forschungsdaten als die Beschreibungen von Gegenstandsklassen jeder Art charakterisieren, die als Wissen qualifiziert werden oder deren Pr\u00fcfung auf diesen Status aussteht. Forschungsdaten als Wissen \u00fcber die Eigenschaften von Forschungsobjekten mit allen methodischen Bewertungen durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft werden dabei von beliebigen Informationen unterschieden: Forschungsdaten werden kollaborativ, offen und kritisch gepr\u00fcft; mit ihnen wird ein Geltungsanspruch vertreten, der jederzeit revidiert werden kann. Die Organisation wissenschaftlicher Kommunikation und das Ethos im Umgang mit Wissen ist daraufhin optimiert, Irrt\u00fcmer zu minimieren. Die etablierten methodologischen Mechanismen sollten auch f\u00fcr Forschungsdaten in allen Wissenschaften gelten. F\u00fcr das NFDI4SD ist dieser besondere Status von Forschungsdaten im Konzert aller wissenschaftlicher Disziplinen \u2013 auch und besonders der sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher \u2013 Hauptaugenmerk f\u00fcr die Aufgaben einer zuk\u00fcnftigen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur. research data RD1 : With Research data scholars and scientists claim fallible knowledge. Research data can be justified and serve as justifying grounds. Research data are open to epistemic qualification. For this they must be computationally identified in all times independent of their symbolic form. All epistemic qualification are transparent to the community. Mit dem Begriff \"epistemic qualification\" k\u00f6nnen alle zus\u00e4tzlichen Attribute zusammengefasst werden, die f\u00fcr eine Auszeichnung und Behandlung von Forschungsdaten als Wissen relevant sind. Forschungsdaten lassen sich nach den Komponenten des Gehalts der Daten, ihrer Metadaten und der epistemischen Qualifikation unterscheiden. Der Gehalt der Forschungsdaten meint die von den Daten beschriebenen Eigenschaften der Forschungsgegenst\u00e4nde. Forschungsdaten umfassen immer beides: ihren Gehalt und die zus\u00e4tzlichen Attribute. Eine Infrastruktur von Forschungsdaten muss entsprechend ihre Integrit\u00e4t ber\u00fccksichtigen und sorgsam beibehalten. Hier kann eine Analogie zur Paratext -Debatte [@zotero-40395] der letzten Jahre hergestellt werden: Basierend auf dem von G\u00e9rard Genette (1930\u20132018) eingef\u00fchrten philologischen Begriff werden Paratexte (unterteilt in Peri- und Epitext ) als jene einem (urspr\u00fcnglich literarischen) Basistext beigef\u00fcgten Elemente bezeichnet, welche Rezeption und Vertrieb eines Werkes entscheidend mitpr\u00e4gen und steuern, darunter Informationen zum Autor, Verlag, Titelei, Vorwort, Dank etc. 4 Dieses Konzept, das gr\u00f6\u00dfere Aufmerksamkeit auf Produktionsprozesse und Autorisierungsinstanzen lenkt, wurde in der weiteren Forschung sukzessive um Textgattungen und Formate neuer Medien erweitert. Im Kontext der Digitalisierung wissenschaftlicher Daten hei\u00dft das: Gerade die Pr\u00fcfung, Autorisierung und nachhaltige Pr\u00e4sentation von Forschungsdaten wird entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Wahrung und Weiterentwicklung nationaler wie internationaler Standards und Qualit\u00e4tsanspr\u00fcche haben. research data RD2 : Research-data are a composit of data-content, metadata and epistemic attributes. It unifies all those information about data-sources like texts including their paratexts. Their composition will adhere epistemic principles enhancing the requirements of obtaining, accessing and maintaining scientific knowledge. Der Physiker und Philosoph Hans Reichenbach unterschied ab den 1920er-Jahren f\u00fcr die wissenschaftliche Beurteilung von Aussagen den Entdeckungszusammenhang vom Rechtfertigungszusammenhang. Der Entdeckungszusammenhang ber\u00fccksichtigt Gr\u00fcnde, die zu einer neuen Einsicht und Beurteilung wissenschaftlicher Sachverhalte f\u00fchren. Davon zu trennen sind die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr die Rechtfertigung von Aussagen \u2013 unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob es sich um theoretische Hypothesen oder den Gehalt von Forschungsdaten handelt. Aus der Perspektive der Forscher, die auf der Suche nach wissenschaftlichen Antworten sind und dazu Forschungsdaten erstellen und weiternutzen, steht der Entdeckungszusammenhang im Vordergrund. Dabei wird \u00fcbersehen, dass auch ein Entdeckungsprozess immer wieder auf auf bereits gerechtfertigtes Wissen st\u00fctzt. Forschungsdaten werden besonders sorgf\u00e4ltig validiert, wenn sie bereits w\u00e4hrend des Forschungsprozesses versioniert f\u00fcr die Publikation bearbeitet werden. research data RD3 : Der Wert von Forschungsdaten muss immer aus der Perspektive des weiteren Nutzens durch andere beurteilt werden, und nicht aus der Perspektive der ersten Person im Entdeckungsprozess. Die Rechtfertigung von Wissen \u2013 und damit um Geltung von Forschungsdaten \u2013 ist immer eine kollaborative Aufgabe der gesamten Forschungsgemeinschaft. Die Forschungsdateninfrastruktur muss deshalb f\u00fcr Mittel sorgen, mit denen die Provenienz der Forschungsdaten und epistemische Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten von Dritten nachvollzogen werden k\u00f6nnen. Gerade dies ist derzeit selten gew\u00e4hrleistet. research data RD4 : Die Rechtfertigung der Daten durch andere Forschungsdaten soll m\u00f6glichst transparent und nachvollziehbar sein. Ein \"dependency graph\" kann die Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der Forschungsdaten von anderen Forschungsdaten aufzeigen und damit die epistemischen Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten untereinander verdeutlichen. Es soll erkennbar sein, von welchen wissenschaftlichen Annahmen die Geltung von Forschungsdaten abh\u00e4ngt. Innerhalb einer innovativen Wissenschaftsorganisation folgt daraus f\u00fcr neu gewonnene Forschungsdaten, dass diese m\u00f6glichst schnell und vollst\u00e4ndig hinsichtlich ihrer epistemischen Qualifikation anderen Forscherinnen und Forschern zug\u00e4nglich gemacht weren m\u00fcssen. Dieser Akt der \u00dcbergabe von Forschungsdaten aus den H\u00e4nden der im Entdeckungszusammenhang arbeitenden Forschenden in die wissenschaftliche \u00d6ffentlichkeit verdient einen eigenen, besonderen Begriff: die wissenschaftliche Publikation . research data RD5 : Publication. Die Publikation von Forschungsdaten ist der Akt der \u00dcbergabe von erstellten Befunden von Daten im Entdeckungszusammenhang an die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft. Erst dadurch werden Ergebnisse zu rechtfertigbarem Wissen. Den Status von research data erhalten empirische Befunde erst durch die wissenschaftliche Publikation. Datenpublikation f\u00fchren zu zitierf\u00e4higen Datenbest\u00e4nden, die von anderen Forschenden wie die derzeitige Forschungsliteratur in einer Bibliographie gelistet wird. Das letztgenannte Prinzip f\u00fchrt in der Konsequenz dazu, die Forschungsdatenpublikation m\u00f6glichst rechtzeitig im Managementplan zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Eine sequentielle Abfolge von Prozessen, die eine Publikation von Forschungsdaten erst nach Abschlu\u00df eines Projektes nach allen anderen abgeschlossenen T\u00e4tigkeit vorsieht, ist somit wissenschaftstheoretisch unvern\u00fcnftig und schadet einer innovativen Wissenschaft. Die Datenpublikation und die innovative Datenzitation werden dazu f\u00fchren, dass Forschungsprojekte eine gro\u00dfe wissenchaftliche Sichtbarkeit erlangen und die eigenen Datenpublikation den Impact des Projektes und der daran Beteiligten wesentlich steigern. research data RD6 Citing research data. The reuse of research data for other data or in textual publication should cite the origin. Citing research data should be listed in bibliographies or lists of references like any other scholarly source. Its publication format resembles the reference styles like any other bibliographical source. Citations can be managed and administered in citation databases or tools. W\u00e4hrend der Laufzeit von Forschungsprojekten entstehen viele Forschungsdaten zu anderen Daten. Die neuen Daten annotieren, verlinken oder werden in anderer Hinsicht f\u00fcr den weiteren Verlauf der Forschungen ben\u00f6tigt. Der Umfang dieser Forschungsdaten ist riesig, und dennoch werden sie derzeit nur in geringem Umfang selbst publiziert. Diese Datenbest\u00e4nde verg\u00f6\u00dfern den Nutzen der mit ihnen verbundenen Daten erheblich. research data RD7 Enhancing research data. Modern research projects create during the research process rich additional research data. Institutional consequences: FAIR use Wir verstehen die FAIR Prinzipien als Anforderungen an eine Infrastruktur, die dem Status von Forschungsdaten als Wissensbestand f\u00fcr eine kollaborative, offene Wissenschaft dienen muss. Um diese Voraussetzungen zu schaffen, verpflichteten sich die internationalen Forschungsverb\u00e4nde und Institutionen auf die Umsetzung der FAIR principles. Zunehmend kn\u00fcpfen F\u00f6rderinstitutionen die Mittelvergabe an erf\u00fcllte FAIR Bedingungen. Diese k\u00f6nnen aber heute von Forschern allein nicht garantiert werden: Insbesondere agile Forschungsvorhaben in den kleinen F\u00e4chern verf\u00fcgen nicht \u00fcber die Ressourcen, um die besonderen Anforderungen der Bereitstellung und Nutzung von Forschungsdaten zu realisieren. Dazu braucht es zuk\u00fcnftig eine wissenschaftsgetragene Infrastruktur. Von den vielen Implementationen der FAIR principles folgen wir den Vorschl\u00e4gen der GO FAIR initiative. 1 Diese formuliert ihre Vision wie folgt: \"Fostering the coherent development of the global Internet of FAIR Data & Services (IFDS), with the main focus on early developments in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).\" Citing its website: 2 research data RD8 : The FAIR principles (below) regulate the implementation of technical usage of research data. They will guide the implementation of NFDI4SD research data infrastructure. Findable The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process. F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below) F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource Accessible Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

Sie sind damit keine Erfindung des digitalen Zeitalters. Datenkataloge wie Ptolemy\u2019s Geography haben die Orte und Wege der antiken Welt geordnet, und mithilfe seiner Handy Tables bestimmten Gelehrte die Konstellation der Gestirne. Auch Kalender und damit verbundene religi\u00f6se Feste orientierten sich an Forschungsdaten, und Lexika normierten nicht zuletzt das Fachverst\u00e4ndnis und die Kommunikation von Wissen. Umfangreiche Sammlungen von Forschungsdaten schufen den Erfolg der Wissenschaft im engen Zusammenspiel mit der Entwicklung gro\u00dfer Theorien \u2013 doch sie trugen als kollaborative Gemeinschaftswerke h\u00e4ufig keinen Autorennamen. Forschungsdaten werden in allen Wissenschaftskulturen mit gr\u00f6\u00dfter Sorgfalt epistemisch gepr\u00fcft. Es sind Wissensbest\u00e4nde, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig untersucht werden, um Irrt\u00fcmer m\u00f6glichst schnell zu identifizieren und validierte Daten auszuzeichnen. Forschungsdaten sind demnach nicht einfach Informationen, die im digitalen Zeitalter im Internet verbreitet, mit anderen Daten verlinkt und offen zug\u00e4nglich ohne Ansehen ihres Wahrheitsgehalts weiter genutzt werden. Es handelt sich auch nicht um \u201cclosed data\u201d, die wie ein esoterischer Schatz nur auf Basis von Privilegien zug\u00e4nglich sind. Die Wissenschaft hat den Begriff des Wissens eingef\u00fchrt, um diesen besonderen Status von Informationen \u00fcber Gesellschaft und Welt zu kennzeichnen. Mit wissenschaftstheoretischer Allgemeinheit k\u00f6nnen wir Forschungsdaten als die Beschreibungen von Gegenstandsklassen jeder Art charakterisieren, die als Wissen qualifiziert werden oder deren Pr\u00fcfung auf diesen Status aussteht. Forschungsdaten als Wissen \u00fcber die Eigenschaften von Forschungsobjekten mit allen methodischen Bewertungen durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft werden dabei von beliebigen Informationen unterschieden: Forschungsdaten werden kollaborativ, offen und kritisch gepr\u00fcft; mit ihnen wird ein Geltungsanspruch vertreten, der jederzeit revidiert werden kann. Die Organisation wissenschaftlicher Kommunikation und das Ethos im Umgang mit Wissen ist daraufhin optimiert, Irrt\u00fcmer zu minimieren. Die etablierten methodologischen Mechanismen sollten auch f\u00fcr Forschungsdaten in allen Wissenschaften gelten. F\u00fcr das NFDI4SD ist dieser besondere Status von Forschungsdaten im Konzert aller wissenschaftlicher Disziplinen \u2013 auch und besonders der sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher \u2013 Hauptaugenmerk f\u00fcr die Aufgaben einer zuk\u00fcnftigen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur. research data RD1 : With Research data scholars and scientists claim fallible knowledge. Research data can be justified and serve as justifying grounds. Research data are open to epistemic qualification. For this they must be computationally identified in all times independent of their symbolic form. All epistemic qualification are transparent to the community. Mit dem Begriff \"epistemic qualification\" k\u00f6nnen alle zus\u00e4tzlichen Attribute zusammengefasst werden, die f\u00fcr eine Auszeichnung und Behandlung von Forschungsdaten als Wissen relevant sind. Forschungsdaten lassen sich nach den Komponenten des Gehalts der Daten, ihrer Metadaten und der epistemischen Qualifikation unterscheiden. Der Gehalt der Forschungsdaten meint die von den Daten beschriebenen Eigenschaften der Forschungsgegenst\u00e4nde. Forschungsdaten umfassen immer beides: ihren Gehalt und die zus\u00e4tzlichen Attribute. Eine Infrastruktur von Forschungsdaten muss entsprechend ihre Integrit\u00e4t ber\u00fccksichtigen und sorgsam beibehalten. Hier kann eine Analogie zur Paratext -Debatte [@zotero-40395] der letzten Jahre hergestellt werden: Basierend auf dem von G\u00e9rard Genette (1930\u20132018) eingef\u00fchrten philologischen Begriff werden Paratexte (unterteilt in Peri- und Epitext ) als jene einem (urspr\u00fcnglich literarischen) Basistext beigef\u00fcgten Elemente bezeichnet, welche Rezeption und Vertrieb eines Werkes entscheidend mitpr\u00e4gen und steuern, darunter Informationen zum Autor, Verlag, Titelei, Vorwort, Dank etc. 4 Dieses Konzept, das gr\u00f6\u00dfere Aufmerksamkeit auf Produktionsprozesse und Autorisierungsinstanzen lenkt, wurde in der weiteren Forschung sukzessive um Textgattungen und Formate neuer Medien erweitert. Im Kontext der Digitalisierung wissenschaftlicher Daten hei\u00dft das: Gerade die Pr\u00fcfung, Autorisierung und nachhaltige Pr\u00e4sentation von Forschungsdaten wird entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Wahrung und Weiterentwicklung nationaler wie internationaler Standards und Qualit\u00e4tsanspr\u00fcche haben. research data RD2 : Research-data are a composit of data-content, metadata and epistemic attributes. It unifies all those information about data-sources like texts including their paratexts. Their composition will adhere epistemic principles enhancing the requirements of obtaining, accessing and maintaining scientific knowledge. Der Physiker und Philosoph Hans Reichenbach unterschied ab den 1920er-Jahren f\u00fcr die wissenschaftliche Beurteilung von Aussagen den Entdeckungszusammenhang vom Rechtfertigungszusammenhang. Der Entdeckungszusammenhang ber\u00fccksichtigt Gr\u00fcnde, die zu einer neuen Einsicht und Beurteilung wissenschaftlicher Sachverhalte f\u00fchren. Davon zu trennen sind die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr die Rechtfertigung von Aussagen \u2013 unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob es sich um theoretische Hypothesen oder den Gehalt von Forschungsdaten handelt. Aus der Perspektive der Forscher, die auf der Suche nach wissenschaftlichen Antworten sind und dazu Forschungsdaten erstellen und weiternutzen, steht der Entdeckungszusammenhang im Vordergrund. Dabei wird \u00fcbersehen, dass auch ein Entdeckungsprozess immer wieder auf auf bereits gerechtfertigtes Wissen st\u00fctzt. Forschungsdaten werden besonders sorgf\u00e4ltig validiert, wenn sie bereits w\u00e4hrend des Forschungsprozesses versioniert f\u00fcr die Publikation bearbeitet werden. research data RD3 : Der Wert von Forschungsdaten muss immer aus der Perspektive des weiteren Nutzens durch andere beurteilt werden, und nicht aus der Perspektive der ersten Person im Entdeckungsprozess. Die Rechtfertigung von Wissen \u2013 und damit um Geltung von Forschungsdaten \u2013 ist immer eine kollaborative Aufgabe der gesamten Forschungsgemeinschaft. Die Forschungsdateninfrastruktur muss deshalb f\u00fcr Mittel sorgen, mit denen die Provenienz der Forschungsdaten und epistemische Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten von Dritten nachvollzogen werden k\u00f6nnen. Gerade dies ist derzeit selten gew\u00e4hrleistet. research data RD4 : Die Rechtfertigung der Daten durch andere Forschungsdaten soll m\u00f6glichst transparent und nachvollziehbar sein. Ein \"dependency graph\" kann die Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der Forschungsdaten von anderen Forschungsdaten aufzeigen und damit die epistemischen Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten untereinander verdeutlichen. Es soll erkennbar sein, von welchen wissenschaftlichen Annahmen die Geltung von Forschungsdaten abh\u00e4ngt. Innerhalb einer innovativen Wissenschaftsorganisation folgt daraus f\u00fcr neu gewonnene Forschungsdaten, dass diese m\u00f6glichst schnell und vollst\u00e4ndig hinsichtlich ihrer epistemischen Qualifikation anderen Forscherinnen und Forschern zug\u00e4nglich gemacht weren m\u00fcssen. Dieser Akt der \u00dcbergabe von Forschungsdaten aus den H\u00e4nden der im Entdeckungszusammenhang arbeitenden Forschenden in die wissenschaftliche \u00d6ffentlichkeit verdient einen eigenen, besonderen Begriff: die wissenschaftliche Publikation . research data RD5 : Publication. Die Publikation von Forschungsdaten ist der Akt der \u00dcbergabe von erstellten Befunden von Daten im Entdeckungszusammenhang an die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft. Erst dadurch werden Ergebnisse zu rechtfertigbarem Wissen. Den Status von research data erhalten empirische Befunde erst durch die wissenschaftliche Publikation. Datenpublikation f\u00fchren zu zitierf\u00e4higen Datenbest\u00e4nden, die von anderen Forschenden wie die derzeitige Forschungsliteratur in einer Bibliographie gelistet wird. Das letztgenannte Prinzip f\u00fchrt in der Konsequenz dazu, die Forschungsdatenpublikation m\u00f6glichst rechtzeitig im Managementplan zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Eine sequentielle Abfolge von Prozessen, die eine Publikation von Forschungsdaten erst nach Abschlu\u00df eines Projektes nach allen anderen abgeschlossenen T\u00e4tigkeit vorsieht, ist somit wissenschaftstheoretisch unvern\u00fcnftig und schadet einer innovativen Wissenschaft. Die Datenpublikation und die innovative Datenzitation werden dazu f\u00fchren, dass Forschungsprojekte eine gro\u00dfe wissenchaftliche Sichtbarkeit erlangen und die eigenen Datenpublikation den Impact des Projektes und der daran Beteiligten wesentlich steigern. research data RD6 Citing research data. The reuse of research data for other data or in textual publication should cite the origin. Citing research data should be listed in bibliographies or lists of references like any other scholarly source. Its publication format resembles the reference styles like any other bibliographical source. Citations can be managed and administered in citation databases or tools. W\u00e4hrend der Laufzeit von Forschungsprojekten entstehen viele Forschungsdaten zu anderen Daten. Die neuen Daten annotieren, verlinken oder werden in anderer Hinsicht f\u00fcr den weiteren Verlauf der Forschungen ben\u00f6tigt. Der Umfang dieser Forschungsdaten ist riesig, und dennoch werden sie derzeit nur in geringem Umfang selbst publiziert. Diese Datenbest\u00e4nde verg\u00f6\u00dfern den Nutzen der mit ihnen verbundenen Daten erheblich. research data RD7 Enhancing research data.

Die fortschreitende Digitalisierung und die Open-Access-Bewegung haben zu einer Transformation des Forschungsprozesses und zur st\u00e4rkeren Verbreitung von Forschungsdaten gef\u00fchrt. Im Zuge dieser Entwicklung haben sich wissenschaftliche Institutionen wie Universit\u00e4ten, Forschungseinrichtungen aber auch kleinere Gruppen und Akteure zur nachhaltigen Verwaltung und zum interdisziplin\u00e4ren Austausch von Forschungsdaten verpflichtet. Die Initiative zum Aufbau einer Nationalen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur tr\u00e4gt diesen massiven strukturellen Wandel Rechnung. Damit verbunden sind die systematische Planung, Sammlung, Verarbeitung, Analyse, Archivierung, Publikation und der Austausch von Daten unterschiedlichen Typs zur Wiederverwendung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft sowie durch eine breite interessierte \u00d6ffentlichkeit. Hierbei waren und sind insbesondere Geistes-, Kultur- und Sozialwissenschaften vor neue Herausforderungen gestellt, da Forschungsdatenmanagement und standardisierter Datenaustausch oft weniger selbstverst\u00e4ndlich in ihre disziplin\u00e4re Kultur und Infrastruktur integriert sind, als im Fall der Lebens- oder Naturwissenschaften. Die hiermit verbundenen Anforderungen sind gerade die sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher eine besonders schwer zu meistern. Hierzu geh\u00f6ren derzeit deutschlandweit \u00fcber 150 F\u00e4cher, \u00fcberwiegend geistes-, sozial- und kulturwissenschaftliche Disziplinen, die institutionell und ihrem Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis nach keine blo\u00dfen Teildisziplinen eines gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichs darstellen. 1 Die langfristige F\u00f6rderung und Sicherung des Fortbestehens dieser F\u00e4cher stellt ein hochrangiges hochschulpolitisches Ziel f\u00fcr die Lehr- und Forschungsinfrastruktur in Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt dar, wie Bundesbildungsministerin Anja Karliczek betont hat: \u201eAuf die vielen gro\u00dfen Fragen unserer Gesellschaft, nicht zuletzt was sie zusammenh\u00e4lt, geben die Kleinen F\u00e4cher wertvolle Antworten. Sie schaffen bedeutsames Wissen und tragen dazu bei, unser kulturelles Erbe zu bewahren.\" 2 For further references please click image Buchwissenschaft Digital Humanities Sinologie Public Health Vorderasiatische Arch\u00e4ologie Kartographie Wissenschaftsgeschichte Osteuropastudien Musikp\u00e4dagogik Numismatik Geochemie Mittellatein Museologie Science and Technology Studies Turkologie Ethik der Medizin Japanologie Bergbau Gleichwohl k\u00f6nnen kleine F\u00e4cher beim Aufbau von modernen Forschungsdateninfrastrukturen nicht oder nicht in notwendigem Umfang auf die Ressourcen jener Institutionen zugreifen, an welche sie i.d.R. organisatorisch angebunden sind. Sie verf\u00fcgen jedoch auch nicht \u00fcber notwendige eigene Mittel und Strukturen, um die spezifischen Bed\u00fcrfnisse ihrer wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft im Hinblick auf modernes Forschungsdatenmanagement zu unterst\u00fctzen, bestehende Praktiken an neue Standards anzupassen und so kompatible, nutzerorientierte Konzepte f\u00fcr Datenaustausch, -sicherung und -wiederverwendung zu implementieren. Wie die vom Bundesbildungsministerium unterst\u00fctzte \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleiner F\u00e4cher\" betont, geh\u00f6rt die Mehrheit der kleinen F\u00e4cher zwar den \u201einsgesamt weniger drittmittelfinanzierten\" Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften an, sie weisen aber (anders als gr\u00f6\u00dfere geistes- und kulturwissenschaftliche F\u00e4cher) eine vergleichsweise \u00fcberdurchschnittliche Drittmittelquote auf \u2013 sowohl hinsichtlich der Anzahl der Antr\u00e4ge wie auch bei den bewilligten Mitteln \u2013, was nicht zuletzt als ein Indikator f\u00fcr einen entsprechend hohen Bedarf angesehen werden kann. 3 Derzeit gibt es keine einheitlichen hochschulpolitischen Rahmenbedingungen f\u00fcr die F\u00f6rderung kleiner F\u00e4cher: In manchen Bundesl\u00e4ndern wurden entsprechende spezielle Programme initiiert, in anderen gibt es keinerlei Ma\u00dfnahmen; erg\u00e4nzt durch F\u00f6rderangebote der jeweiligen Fachgesellschaften oder durch Stiftungen. 4 Ein weiterer hier zu ber\u00fccksichtigender Faktor ist die besonders kollaborativ und transdisziplin\u00e4r ausgerichtete Arbeitsweise kleiner F\u00e4cher, wie es auch im Rahmen eines vom BMBF gef\u00f6rderten Forschungsprojekt zur \u201eDynamik kleiner F\u00e4cher\" von 2019 bis 2022 untersucht wird. 5 Davon sind nicht nur Kooperationen mehrerer kleiner und/oder mittelgro\u00dfer F\u00e4chern betroffen, sondern auch die Lehre und die Betreuung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses: Angesichts der thematischen Breite und Methodenvielfalt k\u00f6nnen Forschungsfragen und -themen in kleinen F\u00e4chern oftmals nur noch durch Beteiligung mehrerer Fachdisziplinen charakterisiert und angemessen bearbeitet werden: Innovationen werden typischerweise durch disziplinen- und kultur\u00fcbergreifende Arbeit im transnationalen Austausch erreicht und ben\u00f6tigen daher in besonderem Ma\u00dfe die digitale Vernetzung, den Austausch von Forschungsdaten und eine leistungsf\u00e4hige und nutzerfreundliche Infrastruktur, um dieses Ziel zu realisieren und f\u00fcr die Zukunft auszubauen. Kleine F\u00e4cher: Formale Kriterien In Abgrenzung zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichen und Teildisziplinen hat die \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleine F\u00e4cher\" der JGU Mainz Kriterien erarbeitet, 8 die im Folgenden als Grundlage zur Bestimmung von Merkmalen, User-Profilen und spezifischen Anforderungen bei der Nutzung von Forschungsdaten herangezogen und erweitert werden sollen. Derzeit geht die Arbeitsstelle von 157 kleinen F\u00e4chern und 2311 Professuren an 89 Standorten bundesweit aus. Diese geh\u00f6ren sechs Fachkulturen an, die sich wiederum in 19 Fachgruppen gliedern: 1) Geisteswissenschaften; 2) Gesundheitswissenschaften; 3) Ingenieurwissenschaften; 4) Kunst- und Kunstwissenschaften; 5) Naturwissenschaften, Agrarwissenschaften und Geographie; 6) Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften. 6 \u00dcber die H\u00e4lfte der kleinen F\u00e4cher geh\u00f6ren den Geisteswissenschaften an, mit einigem Abstand gefolgt von den unter 5) sowie den unter 6) zusammengefassten Fachkulturen. 7 Entscheidend ist in diesem Kontext, dass die spezifischen Interessen vieler der in den Fachkulturen zusammengefassten Fachgruppen bislang nicht oder kaum gesondert angesprochen werden, was nicht zuletzt einer relativ ausgepr\u00e4gten Dynamik im Feld geschuldet ist: Neue kleine F\u00e4cher wie Digital Humanities oder Biodiversit\u00e4t etablieren sich, w\u00e4hrend andere aufgrund eines starken Wachstums den Status als kleines Fach verlieren oder aber ganz in gr\u00f6\u00dferen Disziplinen aufgehen. Als Voraussetzungen gelten hierbei eine Zahl von nicht mehr als drei unbefristete Professuren pro Standort, deutschlandweit sind bis zu zwei Ausnahmen m\u00f6glich. F\u00fcr den jeweiligen Wissenschaftszweig gibt es an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten eigene Professuren mit spezifischen Denominationen. Eigene Studieng\u00e4nge mit qualifiziertem Abschluss: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig ist mit eigenen Studieng\u00e4ngen (Bachelor/ Master/Magister/ Diplom/ Staatsexamen) an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten vertreten. Die Selektion und Ausbildung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses, d.h., die M\u00f6glichkeit der Promotion sowie die Etablierung von Juniorprofessuren mit der Aussicht auf Verstetigung bzw. Tenure-Track-Verfahren. Sozial-kommunikative Ebene Kleine F\u00e4cher kooperieren und kommunizieren nicht mehr nur projektbezogen, sondern sind generell international und kollaborativ ausgerichtet, um den thematisch-strukturell bedingten besonderen Forschungsanforderungen gerecht zu werden. Gleichwohl verf\u00fcgen sie auch \u00fcber eine spezifische Kommunikationsstruktur und daf\u00fcr geeignete Medien sowie ein f\u00fcr die \u00d6ffentlichkeit erkennbares Mindset. Hierzu geh\u00f6rt das Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis als eigenes Fach: Die Professoren und Professorinnen, welche den jeweiligen Wissenschaftszweig an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten vertreten, verstehen diesen als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fach. Vertretung durch eine Fachgesellschaft: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eine nationale oder internationale Fachgesellschaft oder wird in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen von einer \u00fcbergeordneten Fachgesellschaft klar als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fach anerkannt. Dies ist nicht zuletzt die Voraussetzung f\u00fcr den Zugang zu F\u00f6rdermitteln verschiedener Institutionen, worauf kleine F\u00e4cher besonders angewiesen sind. Fachzeitschriften und weitere Kommunikationsorgane: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eigene nationale oder internationale einschl\u00e4gige Publikationsorgane. Zielgruppen und Bed\u00fcrfnisse Es ist erkl\u00e4rtes Ziel des NFDI4SD, eine Infrastruktur und Services f\u00fcr s\u00e4mtliche kleinen F\u00e4cher und die durch sie vertretenen Fachkulturen und -gruppen bereitzustellen und diese in der Umsetzung ihrer individuellen Ziele und Projekte im Sinne eines entwicklungsf\u00e4higen Forschungsdatenmanagements zu unterst\u00fctzen. Dabei soll eine Servicestruktur helfen, die modular nach den jeweiligen Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anforderungen zusammengestellt werden kann. Die unterschiedliche Fach-, Kommunikations und Publikationskultur von scholars wie scientists (im Folgenden verbindend als user, agents oder researcher bezeichnet) muss entsprechend Ber\u00fccksichtigung finden und soll nicht durch statische, unflexible Rahmenbedingungen und Abl\u00e4ufe eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden. So beschrieb auch der Wissenschaftssoziologe Rudolf Stichweh wissenschaftliche Disziplinen im Kontext von Differenzierungs- und Entdifferenzierungsbewegungen 2019 als hoch dynamische Kommunikationssysteme: Die zunehmende Problemorientierung und Projektierung moderner Wissenschaft wird demzufolge durch die Digitalisierung, aber auch neue Anforderungen an berufliche Qualifikation weiter verst\u00e4rkt. 9 Das Konsortium NFDI4SD wird Forscherinnen, Forscher unterschiedicher Disziplinen sowie interessierter Institutionen daher ganz bewusst in den Entwicklungsprozess der neuen Infrastruktur miteinbeziehen, u.a. durch die Nutzung sozialer Medien, die Entwicklung, Verbreitung und Auswertung von Fragekatalogen zum gew\u00fcnschten Serviceangebot sowie die Ausschreibung und F\u00f6rderung von Pilotprojekten. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Erfahrungen sollen in den Aufbau und Entwicklungsprozess des NFDI4SD Eingang finden und sukzessive evaluiert werden. Ziel ist es, die Nachnutzbarkeit von Forschungsdaten durch verschiedenen Handlungsstrategien anzubieten und umzusetzen, da diese ansonsten aufgrund mangelnder Ressourcen \u2013 seien es Zeit, Know-how oder finanzielle Mittel \u2013 f\u00fcr die Allgemeinheit verlorengehen. An dieser Stelle wird ein weiteres Charakteristikum des NFDI4SD deutlich: Es werden ausdr\u00fccklich Projekte in verschiedenen Entwicklungsstadien, Gr\u00f6\u00dfenordnungen sowie mit variierender F\u00f6rderdauer angesprochen, von Qualifikationsprojekten wie Abschlussarbeiten und Dissertationen bis zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Forschungsgruppen in Institutionen und Universit\u00e4ten. Gerade im Fall von Dissertationen ist in vielen Disziplinen bislang prim\u00e4r die abschlie\u00dfende Publikation von Forschungsresultaten Ma\u00dfstab des Gelingens eines Forschungsvorhabens, w\u00e4hrend zugrunde liegende Daten nicht kontextualisiert und systematisch erschlossen werden. Letztere k\u00f6nnen somit auch nicht von anderen zitiert werden bzw. m\u00fcssten hierf\u00fcr erneut bearbeitet werden. Bei umfangreicheren interdisziplin\u00e4ren Forschungsprojekten und Kollaborationen sind die durch die Kommunikation und Bewertungen aus verschiedenen Perspektiven gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Teilergebnisse von besonderer Bedeutung. Die Ver\u00f6ffentlichung von Forschungsdaten und Teilergebnissen, die so eine st\u00e4rkere Dynamik und Relevanz f\u00fcr den Gesamtforschungsprozess entfalten, wird so erleichtert.

Im Zuge dieser Entwicklung haben sich wissenschaftliche Institutionen wie Universit\u00e4ten, Forschungseinrichtungen aber auch kleinere Gruppen und Akteure zur nachhaltigen Verwaltung und zum interdisziplin\u00e4ren Austausch von Forschungsdaten verpflichtet. Die Initiative zum Aufbau einer Nationalen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur tr\u00e4gt diesen massiven strukturellen Wandel Rechnung. Damit verbunden sind die systematische Planung, Sammlung, Verarbeitung, Analyse, Archivierung, Publikation und der Austausch von Daten unterschiedlichen Typs zur Wiederverwendung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft sowie durch eine breite interessierte \u00d6ffentlichkeit. Hierbei waren und sind insbesondere Geistes-, Kultur- und Sozialwissenschaften vor neue Herausforderungen gestellt, da Forschungsdatenmanagement und standardisierter Datenaustausch oft weniger selbstverst\u00e4ndlich in ihre disziplin\u00e4re Kultur und Infrastruktur integriert sind, als im Fall der Lebens- oder Naturwissenschaften. Die hiermit verbundenen Anforderungen sind gerade die sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher eine besonders schwer zu meistern. Hierzu geh\u00f6ren derzeit deutschlandweit \u00fcber 150 F\u00e4cher, \u00fcberwiegend geistes-, sozial- und kulturwissenschaftliche Disziplinen, die institutionell und ihrem Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis nach keine blo\u00dfen Teildisziplinen eines gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichs darstellen. 1 Die langfristige F\u00f6rderung und Sicherung des Fortbestehens dieser F\u00e4cher stellt ein hochrangiges hochschulpolitisches Ziel f\u00fcr die Lehr- und Forschungsinfrastruktur in Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt dar, wie Bundesbildungsministerin Anja Karliczek betont hat: \u201eAuf die vielen gro\u00dfen Fragen unserer Gesellschaft, nicht zuletzt was sie zusammenh\u00e4lt, geben die Kleinen F\u00e4cher wertvolle Antworten.

Derzeit geht die Arbeitsstelle von 157 kleinen F\u00e4chern und 2311 Professuren an 89 Standorten bundesweit aus.

Dabei soll eine Servicestruktur helfen, die modular nach den jeweiligen Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anforderungen zusammengestellt werden kann. Die unterschiedliche Fach-, Kommunikations und Publikationskultur von scholars wie scientists (im Folgenden verbindend als user, agents oder researcher bezeichnet) muss entsprechend Ber\u00fccksichtigung finden und soll nicht durch statische, unflexible Rahmenbedingungen und Abl\u00e4ufe eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden. So beschrieb auch der Wissenschaftssoziologe Rudolf Stichweh wissenschaftliche Disziplinen im Kontext von Differenzierungs- und Entdifferenzierungsbewegungen 2019 als hoch dynamische Kommunikationssysteme: Die zunehmende Problemorientierung und Projektierung moderner Wissenschaft wird demzufolge durch die Digitalisierung, aber auch neue Anforderungen an berufliche Qualifikation weiter verst\u00e4rkt. 9 Das Konsortium NFDI4SD wird Forscherinnen, Forscher unterschiedicher Disziplinen sowie interessierter Institutionen daher ganz bewusst in den Entwicklungsprozess der neuen Infrastruktur miteinbeziehen, u.a. durch die Nutzung sozialer Medien, die Entwicklung, Verbreitung und Auswertung von Fragekatalogen zum gew\u00fcnschten Serviceangebot sowie die Ausschreibung und F\u00f6rderung von Pilotprojekten. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Erfahrungen sollen in den Aufbau und Entwicklungsprozess des NFDI4SD Eingang finden und sukzessive evaluiert werden. Ziel ist es, die Nachnutzbarkeit von Forschungsdaten durch verschiedenen Handlungsstrategien anzubieten und umzusetzen, da diese ansonsten aufgrund mangelnder Ressourcen \u2013 seien es Zeit, Know-how oder finanzielle Mittel \u2013 f\u00fcr die Allgemeinheit verlorengehen. An dieser Stelle wird ein weiteres Charakteristikum des NFDI4SD deutlich: Es werden ausdr\u00fccklich Projekte in verschiedenen Entwicklungsstadien, Gr\u00f6\u00dfenordnungen sowie mit variierender F\u00f6rderdauer angesprochen, von Qualifikationsprojekten wie Abschlussarbeiten und Dissertationen bis zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Forschungsgruppen in Institutionen und Universit\u00e4ten.

Bei umfangreicheren interdisziplin\u00e4ren Forschungsprojekten und Kollaborationen sind die durch die Kommunikation und Bewertungen aus verschiedenen Perspektiven gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Teilergebnisse von besonderer Bedeutung. Die Ver\u00f6ffentlichung von Forschungsdaten und Teilergebnissen, die so eine st\u00e4rkere Dynamik und Relevanz f\u00fcr den Gesamtforschungsprozess entfalten, wird so erleichtert.","title":"Zielgruppen und Bed\u00fcrfnisse"},{"location":"concept/smalldisciplines-dt/#desiderata","text":"Desideratum D1 Sequential planning tends to place publications at the end of a research process, mostly beyond funding period.

Ongoing digitalisation and the Open Access movement are transforming the research process and are greatly increasing the dissemination of research data. As a result, academic institutions \u2013 such as universities, research institutes but also smaller groups and agents \u2013 are increasingly committing themselves to managing research data sustainably and ensuring the interdisciplinary exchange of data. The initiative to establish a National Research Data Infrastructure, with the aim of reviewing the systematic planning, collection, processing, analysis, archiving, publication and exchange of data of various types to be reused by the scientific community and the general public, reflects this tremendous structural change. The Humanities, Cultural Studies and Social Sciences in particular have been and continue to be faced with new challenges in this regard, since research data management and standardized data exchange are often less naturally integrated into their disciplinary divisions and infrastructures than in the case of the Life Sciences or Natural Sciences. In Germany, the so-called small disciplines, which currently include more than 150 fields of study, mostly in the Humanities, Social and Cultural Sciences, find the challenges associated with these tasks particularly difficult to master. Neither the institutions nor the small disciplines are regarded as being mere sub-disciplines of a larger discipline. The long-term funding and continued existence of these disciplines is a major objective of German higher education and research infrastructure in general. As the Federal Minister of Education and Research Anja Karliczek has emphasised: \u2018The small disciplines provide valuable answers to the many important questions facing our society, not least of all what holds it together. They create significant knowledge and play a part in preserving our cultural heritage.\u2019 For further references please click image Buchwissenschaft Digital Humanities Sinologie Public Health Vorderasiatische Arch\u00e4ologie Kartographie Wissenschaftsgeschichte Osteuropastudien Musikp\u00e4dagogik Numismatik Geochemie Mittellatein Museologie Science and Technology Studies Turkologie Ethik der Medizin Japanologie Bergbau However , when it comes to setting up modern research data infrastructures, the small disciplines do not have access to the resources of the institutions to which, as a rule, they are organisationally linked, or they cannot gain access to them to the extent necessary. They also lack the necessary resources and structures of their own to support the specific needs of their academic community with regard to modern research data management, to adapting existing practices to new standards and thus to implementing compatible, user-oriented concepts for the exchange, backup and reuse of data. As the Arbeitsstelle Kleiner F\u00e4cher or Small Disciplines\u2019 Unit of the Johannes Gutenberg University (JGU) in Mainz has stated, although the majority of small disciplines belong to the Humanities and Cultural Studies, which as a whole receive less external funding than other sectors, they receive a comparatively above-average proportion of third-party funding (unlike major subjects in Cultural Studies and the Humanities). This is the case in terms of both the number of applications and the approved funds, which can be taken to indicate that the small disciplines do indeed have a high need for additional funding. At present, there is no standardised higher education policy framework for the promotion of small disciplines in Germany: some states have initiated special programmes, while others have no measures at all. The respective professional associations or foundations have provided additional funding to the small disciplines. A further factor to be considered is the highly collaborative and transdisciplinary working practices of the small disciplines. These are being investigated in \u2018The Dynamics of Small Disciplines\u2019, a research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research that runs from November 2019 to October 2022. These working methods concern not only the collaborative work undertaken between several small and/or medium disciplines, but also the teaching and supervision of young researchers. Given the breadth of topics and the variety of methods, many of the research questions and topics covered in the small disciplines can often only be adequately addressed by interdisciplinary collaboration: innovations are typically achieved through cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural work in transnational exchanges. The provision of digital networking, the exchange of research data and a powerful and user-friendly infrastructure to help realise and expand these goals in the future are thus of huge importance. The small disciplines: formal criteria In order to differentiate the small disciplines from larger departments and sub-disciplines, the Small Disciplines\u2019 Unit at JGU Mainz has developed a number of criteria that will be used as the basis for determining the characteristics, user profiles and specific requirements when using research data. At present, the unit encompasses 157 small disciplines and 2,311 professorships at 89 locations throughout Germany. These small disciplines fall into six disciplinary divisions : (1) the Humanities; (2) Health Sciences; (3) Engineering and Technology; (4) Art and Art History/Aesthetics ; (5) Natural Sciences, Agricultural Sciences and Geography; and (6) Law, Economics and Social Sciences. They can be further divided into 19 sections . More than half of the small disciplines are fields of study in the Humanities, followed at some distance by the disciplines listed in (5) and (6). A decisive factor in this context is that the specific interests of many of the disciplines grouped together in the six disciplinary divisions have so far not been addressed separately, if at all, which is due, in part at least , to a relatively pronounced dynamic in the field: new small disciplines, such as Digital Humanities or Biodiversity, are becoming established, while others are losing their status as \u2018small\u2019 disciplines, either because the fields of study are growing or because they are being absorbed into larger disciplines. For a field of study to be considered a small discipline: there should be no more than three tenured professorships per location, although up to two exceptions are possible nationwide. The respective discipline will have its own professorships at specific appointment grades. there should be separate study programmes with a degree at the end. The respective academic discipline is represented at German universities with its own study programmes (Bachelor\u2019s degree, Master\u2019s degree, diploma, state exam). young academics, that is, those who have the potential to obtain a doctorate, should be selected and trained. Junior professorships, with the prospect of permanent or tenure-track positions, should be established. Social and communications criteria The small disciplines are no longer simply project-oriented but generally have an international and collaborative focus so that the thematically and structurally determined research requirements can be met. They also have a well-defined communications strategy that includes the use of appropriate types of media as well as a distinct approach for disseminating information to the general public. This includes: the belief in the small discipline as a subject in its own right: the professors who represent the respective branch of academic study at German universities see their fields of study as an independent subject. representation by a learned society: the respective branch of knowledge is represented by a national or international learned society. In exceptional cases, it may be acceptable that the field of study is recognized as an independent subject by a learned society. Crucially, this is a requirement of various institutions for access to funding and on which small disciplines are particularly dependent. professional journals and other forms of written communication: there should be a national or international specialist publication that represents the respective academic discipline. Target groups and their requirements The main objective of the NFDI4SD is to provide services and an infrastructure for all the small disciplines and the academic divisions and groups represented by them so that their scholars can realise their individual goals and projects through viable research data management. A service structure set up modularly according to the respective needs and requirements should be of great help. The various professional, communications and publication cultures of scholars and scientists need to be taken into account and should not be restricted by static and inflexible conditions and processes. In 2019, the sociologist Rudolf Stichweh described academic disciplines in the context of differentiation and dedifferentiation movements as highly dynamic communications systems: digitisation is thus intensifying the increasing emphasis in present-day research on project planning and a problem-centred way of working as is today\u2019s growing demand for higher-level professional qualifications. The NFDI4SD consortium will therefore include researchers from a number of different disciplines as well as interested institutions in the development process of the new infrastructure through, among other things, social media, the development, dissemination and evaluation of questionnaires on the desired service package and the tendering and funding of pilot projects. The knowledge and experience gained will be incorporated into the structure and development process of the NFDI4SD and will be evaluated successively. The aim is to make research data reusable through a number of different action strategies in order to avoid the data being lost owing to a lack of time, expertise or financial means. At this juncture, another feature of the NFDI4SD makes itself known: projects at different stages of development, of varying sizes and with varying funding periods are explicitly addressed, from qualification projects, such as university theses and dissertations, to larger research groups at institutions or universities. The publication of research findings, particularly in the case of doctoral theses, has, in many disciplines, so far been the primary indicator of the success of a research project, while the underlying data were not contextualized or systematically indexed. This meant that the data could not be cited in other academic studies without first having been reworked. In more extensive interdisciplinary research projects and collaborative work, the insights and partial findings gained through communicating with others and making evaluations from a number of different perspectives are of particular importance as they facilitate the publication of research data and partial findings. As a consequence, a stronger dynamic is developed, which benefits the entire research process.

Die fortschreitende Digitalisierung und die Open-Access-Bewegung haben zu einer Transformation des Forschungsprozesses und zur st\u00e4rkeren Verbreitung von Forschungsdaten gef\u00fchrt. Im Zuge dieser Entwicklung haben sich wissenschaftliche Institutionen wie Universit\u00e4ten, Forschungseinrichtungen aber auch kleinere Gruppen und Akteure zur nachhaltigen Verwaltung und zum interdisziplin\u00e4ren Austausch von Forschungsdaten verpflichtet. Die Initiative zum Aufbau einer Nationalen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur tr\u00e4gt diesen massiven strukturellen Wandel Rechnung. Damit verbunden sind die systematische Planung, Sammlung, Verarbeitung, Analyse, Archivierung, Publikation und der Austausch von Daten unterschiedlichen Typs zur Wiederverwendung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft sowie durch eine breite interessierte \u00d6ffentlichkeit. Hierbei waren und sind insbesondere Geistes-, Kultur- und Sozialwissenschaften vor neue Herausforderungen gestellt, da Forschungsdatenmanagement und standardisierter Datenaustausch oft weniger selbstverst\u00e4ndlich in ihre disziplin\u00e4re Kultur und Infrastruktur integriert sind, als im Fall der Lebens- oder Naturwissenschaften. Die hiermit verbundenen Anforderungen sind gerade die sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher eine besonders schwer zu meistern. Hierzu geh\u00f6ren derzeit deutschlandweit \u00fcber 150 F\u00e4cher, \u00fcberwiegend geistes-, sozial- und kulturwissenschaftliche Disziplinen, die institutionell und ihrem Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis nach keine blo\u00dfen Teildisziplinen eines gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichs darstellen. 1 Die langfristige F\u00f6rderung und Sicherung des Fortbestehens dieser F\u00e4cher stellt ein hochrangiges hochschulpolitisches Ziel f\u00fcr die Lehr- und Forschungsinfrastruktur in Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt dar, wie Bundesbildungsministerin Anja Karliczek betont hat: \u201eAuf die vielen gro\u00dfen Fragen unserer Gesellschaft, nicht zuletzt was sie zusammenh\u00e4lt, geben die Kleinen F\u00e4cher wertvolle Antworten. Sie schaffen bedeutsames Wissen und tragen dazu bei, unser kulturelles Erbe zu bewahren.\" 2 For further references please click image Buchwissenschaft Digital Humanities Sinologie Public Health Vorderasiatische Arch\u00e4ologie Kartographie Wissenschaftsgeschichte Osteuropastudien Musikp\u00e4dagogik Numismatik Geochemie Mittellatein Museologie Science and Technology Studies Turkologie Ethik der Medizin Japanologie Bergbau Gleichwohl k\u00f6nnen kleine F\u00e4cher beim Aufbau von modernen Forschungsdateninfrastrukturen nicht oder nicht in notwendigem Umfang auf die Ressourcen jener Institutionen zugreifen, an welche sie i.d.R. organisatorisch angebunden sind. Sie verf\u00fcgen jedoch auch nicht \u00fcber notwendige eigene Mittel und Strukturen, um die spezifischen Bed\u00fcrfnisse ihrer wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft im Hinblick auf modernes Forschungsdatenmanagement zu unterst\u00fctzen, bestehende Praktiken an neue Standards anzupassen und so kompatible, nutzerorientierte Konzepte f\u00fcr Datenaustausch, -sicherung und -wiederverwendung zu implementieren. Wie die vom Bundesbildungsministerium unterst\u00fctzte \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleiner F\u00e4cher\" betont, geh\u00f6rt die Mehrheit der kleinen F\u00e4cher zwar den \u201einsgesamt weniger drittmittelfinanzierten\" Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften an, sie weisen aber (anders als gr\u00f6\u00dfere geistes- und kulturwissenschaftliche F\u00e4cher) eine vergleichsweise \u00fcberdurchschnittliche Drittmittelquote auf \u2013 sowohl hinsichtlich der Anzahl der Antr\u00e4ge wie auch bei den bewilligten Mitteln \u2013, was nicht zuletzt als ein Indikator f\u00fcr einen entsprechend hohen Bedarf angesehen werden kann. 3 Derzeit gibt es keine einheitlichen hochschulpolitischen Rahmenbedingungen f\u00fcr die F\u00f6rderung kleiner F\u00e4cher: In manchen Bundesl\u00e4ndern wurden entsprechende spezielle Programme initiiert, in anderen gibt es keinerlei Ma\u00dfnahmen; erg\u00e4nzt durch F\u00f6rderangebote der jeweiligen Fachgesellschaften oder durch Stiftungen. 4 Ein weiterer hier zu ber\u00fccksichtigender Faktor ist die besonders kollaborativ und transdisziplin\u00e4r ausgerichtete Arbeitsweise kleiner F\u00e4cher, wie es auch im Rahmen eines vom BMBF gef\u00f6rderten Forschungsprojekt zur \u201eDynamik kleiner F\u00e4cher\" von 2019 bis 2022 untersucht wird. 5 Davon sind nicht nur Kooperationen mehrerer kleiner und/oder mittelgro\u00dfer F\u00e4chern betroffen, sondern auch die Lehre und die Betreuung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses: Angesichts der thematischen Breite und Methodenvielfalt k\u00f6nnen Forschungsfragen und -themen in kleinen F\u00e4chern oftmals nur noch durch Beteiligung mehrerer Fachdisziplinen charakterisiert und angemessen bearbeitet werden: Innovationen werden typischerweise durch disziplinen- und kultur\u00fcbergreifende Arbeit im transnationalen Austausch erreicht und ben\u00f6tigen daher in besonderem Ma\u00dfe die digitale Vernetzung, den Austausch von Forschungsdaten und eine leistungsf\u00e4hige und nutzerfreundliche Infrastruktur, um dieses Ziel zu realisieren und f\u00fcr die Zukunft auszubauen. Kleine F\u00e4cher: Formale Kriterien In Abgrenzung zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichen und Teildisziplinen hat die \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleine F\u00e4cher\" der JGU Mainz Kriterien erarbeitet, 8 die im Folgenden als Grundlage zur Bestimmung von Merkmalen, User-Profilen und spezifischen Anforderungen bei der Nutzung von Forschungsdaten herangezogen und erweitert werden sollen. Derzeit geht die Arbeitsstelle von 157 kleinen F\u00e4chern und 2311 Professuren an 89 Standorten bundesweit aus. Diese geh\u00f6ren sechs Fachkulturen an, die sich wiederum in 19 Fachgruppen gliedern: 1) Geisteswissenschaften; 2) Gesundheitswissenschaften; 3) Ingenieurwissenschaften; 4) Kunst- und Kunstwissenschaften; 5) Naturwissenschaften, Agrarwissenschaften und Geographie; 6) Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften. 6 \u00dcber die H\u00e4lfte der kleinen F\u00e4cher geh\u00f6ren den Geisteswissenschaften an, mit einigem Abstand gefolgt von den unter 5) sowie den unter 6) zusammengefassten Fachkulturen. 7 Entscheidend ist in diesem Kontext, dass die spezifischen Interessen vieler der in den Fachkulturen zusammengefassten Fachgruppen bislang nicht oder kaum gesondert angesprochen werden, was nicht zuletzt einer relativ ausgepr\u00e4gten Dynamik im Feld geschuldet ist: Neue kleine F\u00e4cher wie Digital Humanities oder Biodiversit\u00e4t etablieren sich, w\u00e4hrend andere aufgrund eines starken Wachstums den Status als kleines Fach verlieren oder aber ganz in gr\u00f6\u00dferen Disziplinen aufgehen. Als Voraussetzungen gelten hierbei eine Zahl von nicht mehr als drei unbefristete Professuren pro Standort, deutschlandweit sind bis zu zwei Ausnahmen m\u00f6glich. F\u00fcr den jeweiligen Wissenschaftszweig gibt es an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten eigene Professuren mit spezifischen Denominationen. Eigene Studieng\u00e4nge mit qualifiziertem Abschluss: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig ist mit eigenen Studieng\u00e4ngen (Bachelor/ Master/Magister/ Diplom/ Staatsexamen) an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten vertreten. Die Selektion und Ausbildung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses, d.h., die M\u00f6glichkeit der Promotion sowie die Etablierung von Juniorprofessuren mit der Aussicht auf Verstetigung bzw. Tenure-Track-Verfahren. Sozial-kommunikative Ebene Kleine F\u00e4cher kooperieren und kommunizieren nicht mehr nur projektbezogen, sondern sind generell international und kollaborativ ausgerichtet, um den thematisch-strukturell bedingten besonderen Forschungsanforderungen gerecht zu werden. Gleichwohl verf\u00fcgen sie auch \u00fcber eine spezifische Kommunikationsstruktur und daf\u00fcr geeignete Medien sowie ein f\u00fcr die \u00d6ffentlichkeit erkennbares Mindset. Hierzu geh\u00f6rt das Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis als eigenes Fach: Die Professoren und Professorinnen, welche den jeweiligen Wissenschaftszweig an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten vertreten, verstehen diesen als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fach. Vertretung durch eine Fachgesellschaft: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eine nationale oder internationale Fachgesellschaft oder wird in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen von einer \u00fcbergeordneten Fachgesellschaft klar als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fach anerkannt. Dies ist nicht zuletzt die Voraussetzung f\u00fcr den Zugang zu F\u00f6rdermitteln verschiedener Institutionen, worauf kleine F\u00e4cher besonders angewiesen sind. Fachzeitschriften und weitere Kommunikationsorgane: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eigene nationale oder internationale einschl\u00e4gige Publikationsorgane. Zielgruppen und Bed\u00fcrfnisse Es ist erkl\u00e4rtes Ziel des NFDI4SD, eine Infrastruktur und Services f\u00fcr s\u00e4mtliche kleinen F\u00e4cher und die durch sie vertretenen Fachkulturen und -gruppen bereitzustellen und diese in der Umsetzung ihrer individuellen Ziele und Projekte im Sinne eines entwicklungsf\u00e4higen Forschungsdatenmanagements zu unterst\u00fctzen. Dabei soll eine Servicestruktur helfen, die modular nach den jeweiligen Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anforderungen zusammengestellt werden kann. Die unterschiedliche Fach-, Kommunikations und Publikationskultur von scholars wie scientists (im Folgenden verbindend als user, agents oder researcher bezeichnet) muss entsprechend Ber\u00fccksichtigung finden und soll nicht durch statische, unflexible Rahmenbedingungen und Abl\u00e4ufe eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden. So beschrieb auch der Wissenschaftssoziologe Rudolf Stichweh wissenschaftliche Disziplinen im Kontext von Differenzierungs- und Entdifferenzierungsbewegungen 2019 als hoch dynamische Kommunikationssysteme: Die zunehmende Problemorientierung und Projektierung moderner Wissenschaft wird demzufolge durch die Digitalisierung, aber auch neue Anforderungen an berufliche Qualifikation weiter verst\u00e4rkt. 9 Das Konsortium NFDI4SD wird Forscherinnen, Forscher unterschiedicher Disziplinen sowie interessierter Institutionen daher ganz bewusst in den Entwicklungsprozess der neuen Infrastruktur miteinbeziehen, u.a. durch die Nutzung sozialer Medien, die Entwicklung, Verbreitung und Auswertung von Fragekatalogen zum gew\u00fcnschten Serviceangebot sowie die Ausschreibung und F\u00f6rderung von Pilotprojekten. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Erfahrungen sollen in den Aufbau und Entwicklungsprozess des NFDI4SD Eingang finden und sukzessive evaluiert werden. Ziel ist es, die Nachnutzbarkeit von Forschungsdaten durch verschiedenen Handlungsstrategien anzubieten und umzusetzen, da diese ansonsten aufgrund mangelnder Ressourcen \u2013 seien es Zeit, Know-how oder finanzielle Mittel \u2013 f\u00fcr die Allgemeinheit verlorengehen. An dieser Stelle wird ein weiteres Charakteristikum des NFDI4SD deutlich: Es werden ausdr\u00fccklich Projekte in verschiedenen Entwicklungsstadien, Gr\u00f6\u00dfenordnungen sowie mit variierender F\u00f6rderdauer angesprochen, von Qualifikationsprojekten wie Abschlussarbeiten und Dissertationen bis zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Forschungsgruppen in Institutionen und Universit\u00e4ten. Gerade im Fall von Dissertationen ist in vielen Disziplinen bislang prim\u00e4r die abschlie\u00dfende Publikation von Forschungsresultaten Ma\u00dfstab des Gelingens eines Forschungsvorhabens, w\u00e4hrend zugrunde liegende Daten nicht kontextualisiert und systematisch erschlossen werden. Letztere k\u00f6nnen somit auch nicht von anderen zitiert werden bzw. m\u00fcssten hierf\u00fcr erneut bearbeitet werden. Bei umfangreicheren interdisziplin\u00e4ren Forschungsprojekten und Kollaborationen sind die durch die Kommunikation und Bewertungen aus verschiedenen Perspektiven gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Teilergebnisse von besonderer Bedeutung. Die Ver\u00f6ffentlichung von Forschungsdaten und Teilergebnissen, die so eine st\u00e4rkere Dynamik und Relevanz f\u00fcr den Gesamtforschungsprozess entfalten, wird so erleichtert.

Dabei soll eine Servicestruktur helfen, die modular nach den jeweiligen Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anforderungen zusammengestellt werden kann. Die unterschiedliche Fach-, Kommunikations und Publikationskultur von scholars wie scientists (im Folgenden verbindend als user, agents oder researcher bezeichnet) muss entsprechend Ber\u00fccksichtigung finden und soll nicht durch statische, unflexible Rahmenbedingungen und Abl\u00e4ufe eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden. So beschrieb auch der Wissenschaftssoziologe Rudolf Stichweh wissenschaftliche Disziplinen im Kontext von Differenzierungs- und Entdifferenzierungsbewegungen 2019 als hoch dynamische Kommunikationssysteme: Die zunehmende Problemorientierung und Projektierung moderner Wissenschaft wird demzufolge durch die Digitalisierung, aber auch neue Anforderungen an berufliche Qualifikation weiter verst\u00e4rkt. 9 Das Konsortium NFDI4SD wird Forscherinnen, Forscher unterschiedicher Disziplinen sowie interessierter Institutionen daher ganz bewusst in den Entwicklungsprozess der neuen Infrastruktur miteinbeziehen, u.a. durch die Nutzung sozialer Medien, die Entwicklung, Verbreitung und Auswertung von Fragekatalogen zum gew\u00fcnschten Serviceangebot sowie die Ausschreibung und F\u00f6rderung von Pilotprojekten. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Erfahrungen sollen in den Aufbau und Entwicklungsprozess des NFDI4SD Eingang finden und sukzessive evaluiert werden. Ziel ist es, die Nachnutzbarkeit von Forschungsdaten durch verschiedenen Handlungsstrategien anzubieten und umzusetzen, da diese ansonsten aufgrund mangelnder Ressourcen \u2013 seien es Zeit, Know-how oder finanzielle Mittel \u2013 f\u00fcr die Allgemeinheit verlorengehen. An dieser Stelle wird ein weiteres Charakteristikum des NFDI4SD deutlich: Es werden ausdr\u00fccklich Projekte in verschiedenen Entwicklungsstadien, Gr\u00f6\u00dfenordnungen sowie mit variierender F\u00f6rderdauer angesprochen, von Qualifikationsprojekten wie Abschlussarbeiten und Dissertationen bis zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Forschungsgruppen in Institutionen und Universit\u00e4ten. Gerade im Fall von Dissertationen ist in vielen Disziplinen bislang prim\u00e4r die abschlie\u00dfende Publikation von Forschungsresultaten Ma\u00dfstab des Gelingens eines Forschungsvorhabens, w\u00e4hrend zugrunde liegende Daten nicht kontextualisiert und systematisch erschlossen werden. Letztere k\u00f6nnen somit auch nicht von anderen zitiert werden bzw. m\u00fcssten hierf\u00fcr erneut bearbeitet werden. Bei umfangreicheren interdisziplin\u00e4ren Forschungsprojekten und Kollaborationen sind die durch die Kommunikation und Bewertungen aus verschiedenen Perspektiven gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Teilergebnisse von besonderer Bedeutung. Die Ver\u00f6ffentlichung von Forschungsdaten und Teilergebnissen, die so eine st\u00e4rkere Dynamik und Relevanz f\u00fcr den Gesamtforschungsprozess entfalten, wird so erleichtert.","title":"Zielgruppen und Bed\u00fcrfnisse"},{"location":"concept/smalldisciplines/#desiderata","text":"Desideratum D1 Sequential planning tends to place publications at the end of a research process, mostly beyond funding period.

Die Leistungen der kleinen F\u00e4cher sind hinsichtlich ihrer gesellschaftlichen und wissenschaftlichen Bedeutung der Ergebnisse enorm: Die GEPRIS-Datenbank der DFG weist ein hohes F\u00f6rdervolumen aus, und der textliche Publikationsertrag ist erheblich. Auch die im Prozess der Forschung gewonnenen Daten, digitalisierten Ertr\u00e4ge und digitalen Repositorien beeindrucken. Es fehlen jedoch sekund\u00e4re Forschungsdaten, d. h., Daten auf der Basis digitaler Quellen, daraus abgeleitete Forschungsergebnisse und speziell f\u00fcr Forschungszwecke erzeugte Daten \u2013 der Umfang der FAIR publizierten sekund\u00e4ren Forschungsdaten im Verh\u00e4ltnis zu den Leistungsausweisen kleiner F\u00e4cher ist verschwindend gering. Dieses steht im Gegensatz zu ihrer enormen Bedeutung. Es sind diese Daten, die andere Daten und Repositorien erschlie\u00dfen. Sekund\u00e4rdaten sind der eigentliche Motor zuk\u00fcnftiger Digitalisierung. Sie verlinken die Best\u00e4nde miteinander und verkn\u00fcpfen Daten zu gehaltvollen Aussagen. Dieser Umstand ist nicht den Forscherinnen und Forschern anzulasten. Vielmehr kann es wesentlich auf eine fehlende Forschungsdateninfrastruktur zur\u00fcckgef\u00fchrt werden, woraus sich f\u00fcr das NFDI4SD folgende Konsequenzen ergeben: Das NFDI4SD integriert seine zahlreichen Forschungsdaten-Services in laufende Forschungsprojekte und kommt nicht erst zum Abschluss der Projekte zum Tragen. Die Services des NFDI4SD werden Teil des wissenschaftlichen Workflows und dienen nicht nur der Verwaltung und Dokumentation. Forschungsdaten umfassen prinzipiell ihren Gehalt (die eigentlichen Daten) und deren Paratext. APIs und andere Rechenoperationen (computational operations) beziehen sich immer auf die Einheit von Forschungsdaten und Metadaten. Die Entwicklung der Services des NFDI4SD wird durch die enge Einbindung in aktive Forschungsprojekte konsequent von den Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anwendungen der Forscher selbst gesteuert. Das NFDI4SD zielt auf eine agile, umfassende Publikation der Forschungsdaten und deren FAIRe Weiternutzung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft ab. Erprobte wissenschaftliche Publikationskonventionen werden sinngem\u00e4\u00df auf Datenpublikationen \u00fcbertragen. Computations sind Bestandteil des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitsprozesses, der anhand von \"computational notebooks\u201c der nach dem Konzept einer \u201eliterate science\u201c organisiert wird: Die Notebooks sind ausf\u00fchrbare Programme und dokumentieren zugleich im Detail \u2013 und somit f\u00fcr andere Forscherinnen und Forscher nachvollziehbar \u2013 die Arbeitsschritte durch Forschungsdaten. Die Infrastruktur des NFDI4SD orientiert sich konzeptuell an den Forschungsaktivit\u00e4ten der kleinen F\u00e4cher. Sie ist mit ihren Services offen f\u00fcr jedes wissenschaftliche Vorhaben, unabh\u00e4ngig von seiner disziplin\u00e4ren Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit. Forschungsgruppen bzw. Projekte aus den kleinen F\u00e4chern melden ihren Bedarf an Infrastrukturleistungen m\u00f6glichst fr\u00fchzeitig an (im Idealfall bereits vor Projektbeginn) und koordinieren mit dem NFDI4SD die gew\u00fcnschten Services. Damit kann die NFDI4SD bereits w\u00e4hrend des Forschungsprozesses konstruktiv mitwirken und die Erzeugung, Systematisierung, Bearbeitung und Auswertung der Forschungsdaten bis zur Datenpublikation \u2013 und der folgenden Weiternutzung \u2013 unterst\u00fctzen. Forschungsdaten werden vom NFDI4SD mit modernen Mitteln der Computational Sciences nutzbar gemacht: Sie werden selbst zu \"computational objects\" und schaffen damit die Basis f\u00fcr die Erschlie\u00dfung bislang nicht verf\u00fcgbarer Forschungspotentiale. Das NFDI4SD f\u00fchrt mit Forschungsdaten als \"computational objects\" gleichzeitig ein neues Forschungskonzept ein, wobei es sich hier nicht prim\u00e4r um technische Aspekte und Voraussetzungen handelt. Vielmehr werden Forschungsdaten neu verstanden und operational behandelt. Sie bilden die Synthese aus: (1) dem Gehalt der Daten (Text, Images, 3D-Objekte, Databasen, Programme) und (2) dem Paratext, also Informationen zur kontextuellen Umgebung der Forschungsdaten (etwa Metadaten oder Angaben zur Provenienz). Dieses B\u00fcndel an Eigenschaften und Informationen definiert die Forschungsdaten, die im wissenschaftlichen Workflow erzeugt, publiziert und weiterverwendet werden. Das daraus abgeleitete Verfahren erlaubt eine fruchtbare Zusammenarbeit aller internen und externen Mitwirkenden der Forschungsdateninfrastruktur mit ihren jeweils darauf zugeschnitten Aufgabenfeldern (task areas, kurz TA). Forschungsdaten werden bereits w\u00e4hrend der Projektf\u00f6rderung importiert, weiter bearbeitet sowie schnell und nachhaltig publiziert, beispielsweise als \"computational notebooks\". Mit der Registratur der Forschungsdaten des NFDI4SD wird ein weiteres wichtiges Ziel erreicht: Der vorgeschlagene Workflow macht die Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der Forschungsdaten untereinander transparent. Welche Forschungsdaten flie\u00dfen in die Berechnungen anderer ein? Wissenschaftler bzw. Nutzer erkennen damit kritische Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten eigener Daten und k\u00f6nnen die Geltungsbereiche von Forschungsdaten angesichts einer sich dynamisch ver\u00e4ndernden Forschungslandschaft besser einsch\u00e4tzen. Die Terminologie (also Fachsprache, disziplin\u00e4re Kategorisierungen oder Konventionen) zu den Forschungsobjekten wird von den Projekten und ihrer disziplin\u00e4ren Sprachverwendung weitgehend selbst entwickelt und im Austausch mit einer spezifischen Gemeinschaft standardisiert. In den meisten F\u00e4llen wird eine angemessene Nomenklatur also bereits durch die Forschungsprojekte vorgegeben, welche vom NFDI4SD f\u00fcr die Aufbereitung aller Daten verwendet wird. Jedes weitere Forschungsprojekt hilft dabei, ein Netzwerk semantischer verbundener Forschungsterminologien aufzubauen. In dieser Terminologie beschreiben die Forschungsdaten die Eigenschaften einer Gruppe von untersuchten Objekten und werden zur empirischen Grundlage f\u00fcr die Auswertung allgemeiner wissenschaftlicher Befunde. Die NFDI4SD Services sollen leicht verst\u00e4ndlich und ohne gro\u00dfe Einf\u00fchrung oder Studium von Handb\u00fcchern von allen Forschern genutzt werden k\u00f6nnen, die sich beim NFDI4SD angemeldet haben. Mit der Anmeldung erhalten Forscherinnen und Forscher die Zugangsberechtigung f\u00fcr die Cloud-Services des NFDI4SD. Wissenschaftler aller Qualifikationsstufen und Gruppengr\u00f6\u00dfen steuern \u00fcber die Bed\u00fcrfnisse ihrer Forschungsprojekte die Anforderungen an die NFDI4SD-Services. Eine Gruppe der Co-Spokesperson der task area TA1 (research fields) vermittelt und beobachtet den Abstimmungsprozess und bringt die Interessen der Forscher in das Steuerungsgremium der NFDI4SD ein. Mit schnell wachsendem Bedarf und zunehmender Differenzierung der Forschungsfelder wird die Gruppe der Co-Spokesperson aller Voraussicht nach erweitert werden. NFDI4SD-Services werden z.B. von der Arbeitsumgebung eines \"computational notebooks\" aufgerufen. Durch eine zus\u00e4tzliche Zeile im Notebook k\u00f6nnen die Funktionen anstatt von einer lokalen Installation auf die Nutzung von Cloud-Services des NFDI4SD umgeschaltet werden. TA2 entwickelt die Ressourcen f\u00fcr den NFDI4SD Cloud Service, insbesondere die innovativen Komponenten des Machine Learning und Big Data. TA3 entwickelt und betreibt alle Leistungen und Angebote, die aus der Sicht der Weiternutzung f\u00fcr eine hohe Sichtbarkeit der Forschungsdaten und die kollaborative Zusammenarbeit ben\u00f6tigt werden. Die Forschungsdatenpublikation geh\u00f6rt ebenso zu diesem Aufgabenfeld wie die Aus- und Weiterbildung. TA4 Die kollaborative Weiternutzung der Daten st\u00fctzt sich auf Normdaten und Standards. Nutzungsmetriken sowie laufende Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Qualit\u00e4tssicherung (quality assessment) des NFDI4SD geben sofortige R\u00fcckmeldungen f\u00fcr weitere Forschungsanforderungen. TA5 Ist die wichtige Schnittstelle zu allen institutionellen Partnern, externen Datenquellen und Forschungsrepositorien. Diese Abteilung arbeitet die Nutzungsvertr\u00e4ge mit den Partnern aus. Zudem wird von hier aus die Kommunikation der Forschungsdatenpublikation und der NFDI4SD-Services f\u00fcr die wissenschaftliche Community und die interessierte wissenschaftliche \u00d6ffentlichkeit koordiniert. Jede wissenschaftliche Publikation sowie jede Weiternutzung von Forschungsdaten betrifft Aspekte des Urheberrechtes. Forscher sollen bereits zu Beginn eines Projekts die rechtlichen Anforderungen angemessen ber\u00fccksichtigen k\u00f6nnen und werden dabei z. B. von Deep-Learning-Assistenten des NFDI4SD unterst\u00fctzt. NFDI4SD wird in TA6 die Mittel entwickeln, die Forschungsprojekte rechtzeitig auf die Anforderungen hinweisen und Nutzungsvorschl\u00e4ge im Interesse von Forschern und Wissenschaft unterbreiten. Der Mehrwert Researcher Konzeptionell werden Forschungsdaten neu verwendet. Durch einen Prozess vergleichbar mit der Verwandlung eines Manuskripts in ein Buch gestaltet das NFDI4SD aus rechnerischen Inhalten wissenschaftlich verwertbare Forschungsdaten. Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler k\u00f6nnen bereits w\u00e4hrend der Forschungsf\u00f6rderung zentrale Ergebnisse publizieren und in die Community einbringen: Die Resultate werden sofort dokumentiert und flie\u00dfen dann wieder in die eigenen Forschungen und die des Projektes ein. Das Konsortium NFDI4SD sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass wertvollen Forschungsertr\u00e4ge ohne zus\u00e4tzlichen Aufwand und Infrastrukturkosten langfristig erhalten und zug\u00e4nglich bleiben. Wissenschaftlicher Nachwuchs Das NFDI4SD unterst\u00fctzt die angehenden Forscherinnen und Forscher bereits zu Beginn ihrer Untersuchungen, wobei keine zus\u00e4tzlichen Ausgaben f\u00fcr diese anfallen. W\u00e4hrend des Schreibprozesses einer Dissertation k\u00f6nnen gleichzeitig erforderliche Forschungsdaten in einem Format erstellt werden, mit dem sie sowohl in der Arbeit als Zitate ausgewiesen als auch nach dem erfolgreichen Abschluss als Forschungsdaten zusammen mit der Dissertation ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden. Der zu erwartende wissenschaftliche Impact wird um ein Vielfaches gesteigert. Content provider, libraries, archives and repositories Die mittlerweile zug\u00e4nglichen digitalen Ressourcen der Bibliotheken, Archive, Repositorien und Forschungsinstitute erschlie\u00dfen einen wesentlichen Teil unseres kulturellen Erbes. Diese Quellen verdienen es, nicht nur passiv wahrgenommen zu werden. Mit dem neuen Konzept des NFDI4SD werden ihre Inhalte zu Forschungsdaten, die ohne erheblichen zus\u00e4tzlichen Aufwand direkt in den Forschungsprozess eingehen k\u00f6nnen. Der Paratext der Forschungsdaten erh\u00e4lt dabei nicht nur die Angaben des Urhebers und der bereitstellenden Institution. Die weitgehende Integration der Inhalte von Forschungsdaten sorgt auch daf\u00fcr, dass diese k\u00fcnftig in allen weiterf\u00fchrenden Forschungsdaten ausgewiesen werden. Der Wert institutioneller Forschungsdaten wird durch nachfolgende Publikationen zus\u00e4tzlich gesteigert. Gerade kleine Sammlungen und Spezialbest\u00e4nde gewinnen enorm an Bedeutung, weil sie in die Gesamtheit aller Best\u00e4nde gleichberechtigt und ohne Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe integriert werden. Die Forscherinnen der Zukunft werden virtuelle Sammlungen s\u00e4mtlicher Forschungsinstitutionen zur Erweiterung ihrer empirischen Basis nutzen k\u00f6nnen. Alle digitalisierten Inhalte profitieren von modernsten Machine-Learning-Techniken und einer globalen Vernetzung: So kann durch die Anwendung im Rahmen von Forschungsprojekten ohne Eigeninvestitionen der eigne Bestand erschlossen werden. Community Es werden Forschungsdaten verf\u00fcgbar gemacht, die bislang nach Projektabschluss unver\u00f6ffentlicht verschwanden. Man verstand Forschungsdaten als Mittel wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen, die zu Ergebnissen f\u00fchrten \u2013 sobald letztere publiziert waren, fehlte die Infrastruktur, um die Forschungsdaten als eigenst\u00e4ndige Forschungsertr\u00e4ge nutzbar zu machen und auszuweisen. K\u00fcnftig werden sich Forschungsdaten jedoch in allen Disziplinen und gerade in den kleinen F\u00e4chern zu eigenst\u00e4ndigen Publikationen entwickeln. Die Qualit\u00e4t und Bedeutung spezieller Forschungsgebiete f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft insgesamt kann damit gesteigert werden. Die Eigenst\u00e4ndigkeit der NFDI und der unterst\u00fctzenden Institutionen einer europ\u00e4ischen open science Infrastruktur wird eine digitale Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t sicherstellen. NFDI4SD wird ein Nutzungs- und Datenanalyse des wichtigsten Bestandes an Forschungsdaten der Kleinen F\u00e4cher vornehmen. Diese geh\u00f6ren zum Kernbestand des digital cultural heritage. Seine souver\u00e4ne und offene Pflege wird eine der wichtigsten Instrumente unseres cultural heritages. Funding institution Der wissenschaftliche Impact von gef\u00f6rderten Projekten wird viel schneller sichtbar und hilft den Akteuren dabei, Trends schnell zu erkennen und Bed\u00fcrfnisse nach neu ausgerichteten Forschungsfeldern empirisch zu untermauern. Der Wert der Forschungsf\u00f6rderungen steigert sich um ein Vielfaches, da die Leistungen der gef\u00f6rderten Projekte durch die Forschungsdateninfrastruktur unterst\u00fctzt werden. Bislang ungenutzte Ressourcen an Forschungsdaten werden ohne erheblichen Mehraufwand erschlossen und steigern erheblich den Weiternutzungswert bereits vorhandener Daten.","title":"**NFDI Small Disciplines (NFDI4SD)**"},{"location":"concept/summary-dt/#nfdi-small-disciplines-nfdi4sd","text":"","title":"NFDI Small Disciplines (NFDI4SD)"},{"location":"concept/summary-dt/#die-aufgabe","text":"Das NFDI4SD er\u00f6ffnet eine neue Perspektive zur L\u00f6sung eines gravierenden Problems in der gegenw\u00e4rtigen Forschungssituation der sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher.

The latter have achieved much in terms of the social and academic significance of the disciplines\u2019 findings: small disciplines number highly in the DFG's GEPRIS database, while the number of publications in these subject areas is considerable. The data, digitised findings and digital repositories that have been acquired through the research process are also impressive. However, there is a notable lack of secondary research data, that is, data from digital sources, the research findings derived from them and the data generated specifically for research purposes; the volume of FAIR-published secondary research data is negligible in relation to the track record of the small disciplines. This contrasts starkly with the enormous importance of the small disciplines. It is these data that make it possible for researchers to access other data and repositories. Secondary data are the real engine of future digitisation. They connect the data of different collections and combine the data in meaningful ways. Researchers cannot be held responsible for this state of affairs. Rather, it is the absence of an adequate research data infrastructure that is to blame. To help avoid these negative consequences we propose the following infrastructure for the NFDI4SD: The NFDI4SD will integrate its numerous research data services into ongoing research projects, which will come into effect in the early stages of a project. The NFDI4SD\u2019s services will become part of the research workflow and will not just be used for administrative and documentation purposes. Research data basically consists of its content (the actual data) and its paratext. APIs and other computational operations always refer to these entities of research data. The researchers will systematically guide the development of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services according to their needs and practices through their close involvement in the research projects. The NFDI4SD aims to publish the research data and intends that the data will be reused following FAIR principles by the academic community. Data will be published according to tried-and-tested scholarly and scientific publishing conventions. Computations will be part of the work process. They will be organised on the basis of \u2018computational notebooks\u2019, which are based on the concept of \u2018scientific literacy\u2019: the notebooks can be run like computer programs and they will at the same time document in detail, by means of research data, the various work procedures - and so make them understandable to other researchers. Although the infrastructure of the NFDI4SD is conceptually oriented towards the research activities of the small disciplines, thanks to its services it is open to any scholarly or scientific project, regardless of its disciplinary affiliation. Research groups or projects in the small disciplines will need to register their infrastructure service needs as early as possible (ideally before the start of a project) and coordinate the required services with the NFDI4SD. This will enable the consortium to play a constructive role in the research process by supporting the generation, systematisation, processing and evaluation of the research data right up to data publication and the subsequent reuse of the data. The NFDI4SD uses modern computational tools to make research data usable: the data become \u2018computational objects\u2019 and thus lay the groundwork for making previously unavailable research accessible. The NFDI4SD has thus introduced a new research concept, albeit one that is not primarily concerned with technical aspects and requirements. We need to look at research data in a new operational way. The research data combine (1) the content of the data (text, images, 3D objects, databases, programs) and (2) the data\u2019s paratext, that is, information on the contextual environment of the research data (such as metadata or information on the data\u2019s provenance). This bundle of properties and information defines the research data that is generated, published and reused in the research process. The procedure derived from this process will enable all the internal and external participants of the research data infrastructure to collaborate fruitfully within their respective task areas (TAs). The research data will be imported during the project funding stage and then be processed further, finally being published (as \u2018computational notebooks\u2019, for instance) as quickly and sustainably as possible. The registration of the NFDI4SD\u2019s research data will enable us to achieve another important objective: the proposed workflow will make the interdependence of the research data transparent. Which research data will be used in the calculations of other data? Scholars, scientists (hereafter also referred to as agents or researchers) or other users will thus be able to recognise the critical dependencies of their own data and will therefore be able to assess more effectively the scope of the research data in the light of a dynamically changing research landscape. The terminology (that is, the technical language, the disciplinary categorisations or conventions) that relates to the research objects will be largely developed by the project members from the language used in their disciplines and will be standardised by communicating with each specific community. In most cases, the research projects will already have an appropriate nomenclature in place, which will be used by the NFDI4SD to prepare all the data. The members of each additional research project will contribute to building a network of semantically related research terminology. With the help of this terminology, the research data will describe the properties of the group of objects under investigation and the data will therefore become the empirical basis for the evaluation of general findings. The NFDI4SD\u2019s services aim to be easy to understand and user friendly. Once registered, all researchers will receive authorisation to access the NFDI4SD\u2019s cloud services. Researchers of all qualification levels and group sizes will control the requirements of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services through the needs of their research projects. A group of co-spokespeople from task area one \u2013 TA1 (research fields) \u2013 will mediate and monitor the coordination process and will introduce the interests of the researchers to the NFDI4SD\u2019s steering committee. As demand grows and the research fields increasingly differentiate, membership of the group of co-spokespeople is likely to be extended. It will be possible to access NFDI4SD\u2019s services from, for example, the working environment of a \u2018computational notebook\u2019. Simply by inserting an additional line into the notebook, the functions can be switched from a local installation to the use of NFDI4SD\u2019s cloud services. TA2 will develop the resources for the NFDI4SD\u2019s cloud service, in particular the innovative components of machine learning and big data. TA3 will develop and operate all the services and offers that are needed to promote the visibility of collaborations and the reuse of the research data. The publication of research data is as much a part of this field of activity as are further education and training. TA4 The collaborative reuse of data will be based on normative data and standards. Usage metrics and ongoing quality assessment of the NFDI4SD will provide immediate feedback, which can be used to improve future research needs. TA5 This task area is a vital interface for the institutional partners, the external data sources and the research repositories. It will draw up the licence agreements with the partners and will also coordinate the dissemination of the publications and the NFDI4SD\u2019s services to the academic community and to the interested but non-technical general public. TA6 Every publication and every reuse of research data is protected by copyright. Researchers should, from the start of a project, be aware of and comply with copyright issues; NFDI4SD's deep learning-based virtual assistants will provide support in this area. This task area will ensure that researchers know and follow the legal requirements in good time as well as help them submit proposals for the benefit of researchers and science in general. Benefits Research Conceptually, we will use research data in an entirely new way. Not unlike the process of transforming a manuscript into a book, the NFDI4SD will turn computational content into academically usable research data. Researchers will be able to publish their key findings and introduce them to the community while they are still conducting their research: the findings will be immediately documented and they can then be incorporated into the researchers\u2019 own work as well as into the main project. The NFDI4SD consortium will ensure that valuable research findings are preserved and remain accessible in the long term without any additional effort or infrastructure costs. Young scholars and scientists The NFDI4SD will support budding academics from the very beginning of their research and will free them from any additional expenses. While a dissertation is being written up, young scholars and scientists will be able to compile simultaneously any essential research data in a format that will enable the data to be cited in a paper or a data collection and, after it has been successfully completed, published as research data together with the dissertation. This will considerably increase the scientific impact of the research work. Content providers, libraries, archives and repositories The digital resources of libraries, archives, repositories and research institutes that are now accessible have opened up a substantial part of our cultural heritage. These sources should not only be passively appreciated. According to the NFDI4SD\u2019s new concept, the content of these sources has become research data that can be directly incorporated into the research process with very little effort. The author and funding institution details are entered into the paratext database, and, because it is fully integrated, the content of the research data can also be included in all future research data. The value of the research data of these institutions will also be enhanced by the subsequent publication of the data. Small and specialized collections, in particular, are becoming more important as they are now being integrated into every data collection. Future researchers will be able to use the digital collections of other research institutions to expand their empirical base. The latest machine-learning techniques and global connectivity will enhance the effectiveness of all digitised content, which will enable researchers to access their own data stores without having to finance it. Community Unpublished research data that was previously lost after the completion of a project will now be made available. Research data used to be understood as the material commonly accepted as necessary in the scientific community to validate the resulting research findings of a scientific investigation; once the studies had been published, though, there was no infrastructure to make the data usable or to present them as independent research findings. Now, however, it will be possible to publish independently the research data of all subject areas, but especially those of the small disciplines. We should therefore see a rise in the quality and relevance of special research areas in academia generally. Funding institution The findings of funded projects will be able to reach the academic community more swiftly; this will help the actors to identify new trends as quickly as possible and to establish the needs of newly oriented research fields. The value of research funding is greatly enhanced thanks to the support provided by the research data infrastructure. Previously unused resources of research data will be made accessible with little additional effort and they will significantly increase the value of the existing data that is to be reused. The NFDI4SD addresses the European Union's growing concern about the loss of 'digital sovereignty'. The small disciplines, in particular, explore the many different dimensions of our cultural heritage: from languages, culture, history and the sciences to our political and social identity, they increase our understanding of our culture. By publishing research data, the NFDI4SD will store and link the network of our cultural heritage and contribute to making it autonomous, open access and reusable. Maintaining digital sovereignty is a vital feature of the design of the NFDI4SD's infrastructure.","title":"Summary en"},{"location":"concept/summary-en/#the-task","text":"The NFDI4SD consortium has the potential to solve a serious problem in the current state of research in the so-called small disciplines.

Die Leistungen der kleinen F\u00e4cher sind hinsichtlich ihrer gesellschaftlichen und wissenschaftlichen Bedeutung der Ergebnisse enorm: Die GEPRIS-Datenbank der DFG weist ein hohes F\u00f6rdervolumen aus, und der textliche Publikationsertrag ist erheblich. Auch die im Prozess der Forschung gewonnenen Daten, digitalisierten Ertr\u00e4ge und digitalen Repositorien beeindrucken. Es fehlen jedoch sekund\u00e4re Forschungsdaten, d. h., Daten auf der Basis digitaler Quellen, daraus abgeleitete Forschungsergebnisse und speziell f\u00fcr Forschungszwecke erzeugte Daten \u2013 der Umfang der FAIR publizierten sekund\u00e4ren Forschungsdaten im Verh\u00e4ltnis zu den Leistungsausweisen kleiner F\u00e4cher ist verschwindend gering. Dieses steht im Gegensatz zu ihrer enormen Bedeutung. Es sind diese Daten, die andere Daten und Repositorien erschlie\u00dfen. Sekund\u00e4rdaten sind der eigentliche Motor zuk\u00fcnftiger Digitalisierung. Sie verlinken die Best\u00e4nde miteinander und verkn\u00fcpfen Daten zu gehaltvollen Aussagen. Dieser Umstand ist nicht den Forscherinnen und Forschern anzulasten. Vielmehr kann es wesentlich auf eine fehlende Forschungsdateninfrastruktur zur\u00fcckgef\u00fchrt werden, woraus sich f\u00fcr das NFDI4SD folgende Konsequenzen ergeben: Das NFDI4SD integriert seine zahlreichen Forschungsdaten-Services in laufende Forschungsprojekte und kommt nicht erst zum Abschluss der Projekte zum Tragen. Die Services des NFDI4SD werden Teil des wissenschaftlichen Workflows und dienen nicht nur der Verwaltung und Dokumentation. Forschungsdaten umfassen prinzipiell ihren Gehalt (die eigentlichen Daten) und deren Paratext. APIs und andere Rechenoperationen (computational operations) beziehen sich immer auf die Einheit von Forschungsdaten und Metadaten. Die Entwicklung der Services des NFDI4SD wird durch die enge Einbindung in aktive Forschungsprojekte konsequent von den Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anwendungen der Forscher selbst gesteuert. Das NFDI4SD zielt auf eine agile, umfassende Publikation der Forschungsdaten und deren FAIRe Weiternutzung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft ab. Erprobte wissenschaftliche Publikationskonventionen werden sinngem\u00e4\u00df auf Datenpublikationen \u00fcbertragen. Computations sind Bestandteil des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitsprozesses, der anhand von \"computational notebooks\u201c der nach dem Konzept einer \u201eliterate science\u201c organisiert wird: Die Notebooks sind ausf\u00fchrbare Programme und dokumentieren zugleich im Detail \u2013 und somit f\u00fcr andere Forscherinnen und Forscher nachvollziehbar \u2013 die Arbeitsschritte durch Forschungsdaten. Die Infrastruktur des NFDI4SD orientiert sich konzeptuell an den Forschungsaktivit\u00e4ten der kleinen F\u00e4cher. Sie ist mit ihren Services offen f\u00fcr jedes wissenschaftliche Vorhaben, unabh\u00e4ngig von seiner disziplin\u00e4ren Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit. Forschungsgruppen bzw.

Die Leistungen der kleinen F\u00e4cher sind hinsichtlich ihrer gesellschaftlichen und wissenschaftlichen Bedeutung der Ergebnisse enorm: Die GEPRIS-Datenbank der DFG weist ein hohes F\u00f6rdervolumen aus, und der textliche Publikationsertrag ist erheblich. Auch die im Prozess der Forschung gewonnenen Daten, digitalisierten Ertr\u00e4ge und digitalen Repositorien beeindrucken. Es fehlen jedoch sekund\u00e4re Forschungsdaten, d. h., Daten auf der Basis digitaler Quellen, daraus abgeleitete Forschungsergebnisse und speziell f\u00fcr Forschungszwecke erzeugte Daten \u2013 der Umfang der FAIR publizierten sekund\u00e4ren Forschungsdaten im Verh\u00e4ltnis zu den Leistungsausweisen kleiner F\u00e4cher ist verschwindend gering. Dieses steht im Gegensatz zu ihrer enormen Bedeutung. Es sind diese Daten, die andere Daten und Repositorien erschlie\u00dfen. Sekund\u00e4rdaten sind der eigentliche Motor zuk\u00fcnftiger Digitalisierung. Sie verlinken die Best\u00e4nde miteinander und verkn\u00fcpfen Daten zu gehaltvollen Aussagen. Dieser Umstand ist nicht den Forscherinnen und Forschern anzulasten. Vielmehr kann es wesentlich auf eine fehlende Forschungsdateninfrastruktur zur\u00fcckgef\u00fchrt werden, woraus sich f\u00fcr das NFDI4SD folgende Konsequenzen ergeben: Das NFDI4SD integriert seine zahlreichen Forschungsdaten-Services in laufende Forschungsprojekte und kommt nicht erst zum Abschluss der Projekte zum Tragen. Die Services des NFDI4SD werden Teil des wissenschaftlichen Workflows und dienen nicht nur der Verwaltung und Dokumentation. Forschungsdaten umfassen prinzipiell ihren Gehalt (die eigentlichen Daten) und deren Paratext. APIs und andere Rechenoperationen (computational operations) beziehen sich immer auf die Einheit von Forschungsdaten und Metadaten. Die Entwicklung der Services des NFDI4SD wird durch die enge Einbindung in aktive Forschungsprojekte konsequent von den Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anwendungen der Forscher selbst gesteuert. Das NFDI4SD zielt auf eine agile, umfassende Publikation der Forschungsdaten und deren FAIRe Weiternutzung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft ab. Erprobte wissenschaftliche Publikationskonventionen werden sinngem\u00e4\u00df auf Datenpublikationen \u00fcbertragen. Computations sind Bestandteil des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitsprozesses, der anhand von \"computational notebooks\u201c der nach dem Konzept einer \u201eliterate science\u201c organisiert wird: Die Notebooks sind ausf\u00fchrbare Programme und dokumentieren zugleich im Detail \u2013 und somit f\u00fcr andere Forscherinnen und Forscher nachvollziehbar \u2013 die Arbeitsschritte durch Forschungsdaten. Die Infrastruktur des NFDI4SD orientiert sich konzeptuell an den Forschungsaktivit\u00e4ten der kleinen F\u00e4cher. Sie ist mit ihren Services offen f\u00fcr jedes wissenschaftliche Vorhaben, unabh\u00e4ngig von seiner disziplin\u00e4ren Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit. Forschungsgruppen bzw.

Comparison of general research data repositories The General Repository Comparison Chart and FAIRsharing Collection (https://fairsharing.org/collection/GeneralRepositoryComparison) is an outcome of the NIH Workshop on the Role of Generalist Repositories to Enhance Data Discoverability and Reuse held 11-12 February 2020 (workshop summary). Following the workshop, representatives of the participating generalist repositories collaborated to develop a tool researchers could use to make decisions about selecting a general repository.

Distill is a primary publication and will not publish content which is identical or substantially similar to content published elsewhere. To submit an article, first create a GitHub repository for your article.1 You can keep it private during the review process if you would like\u2009\u2014\u2009just share your repository with @distillpub-reviewers. Then email editors@distill.pub to begin the process. Distill handles all reviews and editing through GitHub issues. Upon publication, the repository is made public and transferred to the @distillpub organization for preservation. This means that reviews of published work are always public. It is at the author\u2019s discretion whether they share reviews of unpublished work. However, destill's authoring process has to be much simplified and especially expandedfor integrating research data publication. We believe that interative articles are the perfect platform for documenting and explaining published datasets. NFDI4SD will develop an much more accessible authoring system with zero-additional-skill manuscript writing and support for extending research data inclusion. It will transform the presentation of research data beyond traditional forms of documentation. submitting to ZENODO \u21a9","title":"Interactive articles"},{"location":"sources/NFDI4SD-Kooperationspartner-copy/","text":"NFDI4SD: Liste der Kooperationspartner Spokespeople \u2022 Prof. Dr. Andreas Degkwitz, Universita\u0308tsbibliothek, Unter den Linden 6, 10099 Berlin; email: andreas.degkwitz@ub.hu-berlin.de CV siehe https://www.ub.hu-berlin.de/de/ueber-uns/kontakt/ansprechpartner/dr.-andreas-degkwitz; Publikationsliste siehe https://www.ub.hu-berlin.de/shared/dokumente/kontakt/ansprechpartner/degkwitz/copy_of_degkwitz_publikationsliste_2017 \u2022 Prof. Dr. Gerd Gra\u00dfhoff, Institut fu\u0308r Philosophie, Humboldt-Universita\u0308t zu Berlin; email: gerd.grasshoff@hu-berlin.de CV seit 2010: Professur fu\u0308r Antike Wissenschaftsgeschichte, Humboldt-Universita\u0308t zu Berlin 2010\u20132019: Sprecher des Exzellenzclusters Topoi, Humboldt-Universita\u0308t zu Berlin 2002: Forschungssemester an der University of California in Berkeley / USA 1999 \u2013 2010: Professur fu\u0308r Wissenschaftstheorie und -geschichte, Direktor des Instituts fu\u0308r Philosophie, Mitglied der phil. nat.

These semantic models interpret texts and can identify, e.g., epistemological evaluations of the author, derive inferences from them or compare the author's conclusions about their conflicts with the statements of other contemporaries. Semantic text analyses do not only regard the expression, but rather refer to the content. The fine art of machine learning interpretation shifts the question from \"what does the author write?\" to \"what does the author mean by his text?\". Part of this task uses NFDI4SD service of NLP pipeline path of identifying name entities (NER) used to itentify semantic components. They link syntactic properties of a text fragment with a general semantic feature, e.g. the expressions of various coordinates Kepler mentiones. Ambiguities or subtle additional semantical will be resolved to identify the implicit year for those reported positions.

Four steps show the use and transformation of research data: (1) Research Data import of the English reference edition of Astronomia Nova a. The digital text is linked to the scholarly edition b. The text of the translation is data-linked to the passages of the first edition of Kepler\u2019s Latin original (2) NLP-pipeline (a set of natural language processing services provided by NFDI4SD) creates a new secondary research data with tagged linguistic entities of the English edition.

This model cross-links semantic objects like date/time aspects of observations, events or abstract objects of Kepler\u2019s discovery like forces or epicyclic models. (4) Use services from the visualisation library publish interactive graphic components related to the semantic models. This general scheme is demonstrated by an exemplary (a) Browse through the paragraphs of Kepler\u2019s book (b) Identify the years referred to in the paragraph (c) Show the lunar visibility calculated for that year on the spot. No explicit year is mentioned in the text. Semantic modelling can unambiguously identify the year and could link the data with an interactive computational notebook for visualizing the visible lunar phases for Prague of the mentioned date of the textual passage under consideration. One can select interactively a year for comparing the lunar phases at different years to demonstrate implications the author wants to consider.

This model cross-links semantic objects like date/time aspects of observations, events or abstract objects of Kepler\u2019s discovery like forces or epicyclic models. (4) Use services from the visualisation library publish interactive graphic components related to the semantic models. This general scheme is demonstrated by an exemplary (a) Browse through the paragraphs of Kepler\u2019s book (b) Identify the years referred to in the paragraph (c) Show the lunar visibility calculated for that year on the spot. No explicit year is mentioned in the text. Semantic modelling can unambiguously identify the year and could link the data with an interactive computational notebook for visualizing the visible lunar phases for Prague of the mentioned date of the textual passage under consideration. One can select interactively a year for comparing the lunar phases at different years to demonstrate implications the author wants to consider. Tools will be rapidly published by the community with supporting services from the NFDI4SD and could be instantly reused as open access tools for any other linked data. import {Runtime, Inspector} from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js\"; import define from \"https://api.observablehq.com/d/69a9710f41ccaed0.js?v=3\"; (new Runtime).module(define, name => { if (name === \"viewof year\") return Inspector.into(\"#observablehq-6032dd42 .observablehq-viewof-year\")(); if (name === \"chart\") return Inspector.into(\"#observablehq-6032dd42 .observablehq-chart\")(); });","title":"Kepler' Astronomia Nova"},{"location":"usecases/leo/","text":"Leonard Euler Werke","title":"Euler Edition"},{"location":"usecases/leo/#leonard-euler-werke","text":"","title":"Leonard Euler Werke"},{"location":"usecases/orientation/","text":"Use Cases Purpose and demonstrations through use cases Die thematische und methodische Vielfalt der kleinen F\u00e4cher wird anhand der User Cases vorgestellt.
