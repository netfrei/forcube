These scholars are typically involved in highly collaborative and global long-term projects which use innovative technology, but they often lack the research data and publication infrastructure normally provided by their home institutions. Collaborative projects require agile workflows for all user groups. Data aggregation, preparation, processing, analyses and publications are elements of modern scholarly research. The aim of the NFDI4SD consortium is to provide scholars with research-integrating data along with other scientific activities. By concentrating on the small disciplines, the consortium will be able to provide researchers with the services that they require on a daily basis. The first objective will be to break up the traditional sequential research organization and weave research data, including the publication of the data, into an integrated research process, complemented by a moderated research model that weaves research data into the ongoing research workflow (the \u201ccube\u201d). Objectives Objective O1 : Both the use and production of research data will be tightly integrated into ongoing research projects. From the beginning of science research has been an collaborative enterprise. NFDI4SD services will become integral part of current research via an initial collaborative agreement between new research projects and the NFDI4SD. These agreements will be open to all disciplines, independent of their institutional classification as \u201csmall disciplines\u201d. Currently, the main desideratum of researchers working in the small disciplines is access to modern computational research data beyond the support of their home institutions and third-party funding bodies. As science is per se a collaborative undertaking, the open knowledge exchange is fundamental to innovative and critical science. As a supporting infrastructure, the NFDI4SD will be a novel institutional research partner in the scientific arena. Objective O2 : The NFDI4SD will develop research data services that respond directly to the feedback of research projects. For many years now, the Arbeitsstelle Kleine F\u00e4cher has been recording the institutional settings of small disciplines. It enables direct communication between researchers, students, institutions and, in the future, the NFDI4SD. Modern concepts of computational philosophy of science will guide the software architecture of computational research data flows. Objective O3 : The NFDI4SD will use and supplement best-practice open source tools and computational libraries for services within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The NFDI4SD will be an active member of the German NFDI consortium and will strive to form collaborations with other suitable consortia. It will commit itself to the strategic plans of the EOSC Roadmap and seek membership in the newly created EOSC Association. The proven infrastructure of CERN\u2019s Zenodo service will provide OpenAIRE data publication, data harvesting and the implementation of FAIR data principles to implement the eight ambitions of Open Science. Objective O4 : The signing of agreements with relevant stakeholders \u2013 libraries, archives and other content providers \u2013 on standards, application programming interfaces (APIs) and open access via computer networks. The NFDI4SD governing body will seek to make operational agreements with a number of content-providing institutions on the implementation and accessibility of APIs for the NFDI4SD\u2019s infrastructure hub. These agreements, using widely accepted standards, will enable researchers to access large sets of research data from a large number of content-holding institutions. It is expected that, within a short space of time, the NFDI4SD will be able to provide standardized API and interface modules. The large variety of small disciplines involved will ensure that special collections beyond the major stakeholders will be included in this integrated network of content providers. Objective O5 : The NFDI4SD aims to maximize the visibility of the impact of research New generation metrics monitors will be implemented to monitor the use and impact of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services as part of the consortium\u2019s support of the research projects. Daily updated monitors and impact indicators will enable researchers to assess their collaborative global network as well as inform the NFDI4SD\u2019s governing body of hotspots of usage and of the need to steer users towards a particular course of action. Objective O6 : Publication and citizen science All scientific output for general scholarly use will be regarded as published material. Such material goes beyond putting data on a file server: publications implement FAIR data principles and use review, curation and scholarly assessments. The NFDI4SD intends to establish new procedures and references for data publications in order to enhance to a significant degree the impact of research. Task areas The nature, benefits and characteristics of research data are surprisingly complex: data exist in many different media formats and contribute to the information value of the subjects of research; and researchers benefit from the rapid exchange of their publications and research findings. A Research Management Plan will coordinate the use and interoperability of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services. Internal and external forms of communicating for research purposes, data storage, usage and revision as well as full-page archiving, including the final publication of research results and research data, will all form part of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services. The workflow of research activities in the context of highly collaborative, agile scientific communities occurs at the interplay between data and theory, using \u2013 among other things \u2013 computational means. Such activities can neither be ordered as a linear sequence of tasks, nor as a research data life cycle. The organization of the workflow of research activities has been designed using Thomas Kuhn\u2019s metaphor of science as a puzzle-solving activity. We describe the pipeline of scientific processes as the transformation of input data via research pipes into designed outcomes. This sequence of operation can be compared to the rotations of a multidimensional research cube (solving Rubik\u2019s cube, for example). The cube\u2019s faces represent the content, data, skills, or means of the research activities. Each single step (aka cube\u2019s rotation leads to a new configuration). This puzzle-solving metaphor facilitates the orchestration of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services into research activities by organizing and communicating the growing repertoire of the NFDI4SD\u2019s manifold of research data services. The cube describes the requirements, standards and quality of data, as well as their information, metadata and documentation, in order to assure the best usage of services. The NFDI4SD can confidently base its operation on a wide spectrum of standards, API norms, data formats as recommended by the European Open Science Cloud and other standard institutions. The NFDI4SD will rapidly develop a user-friendly service catalogue which will serve as a graphical user interface (GUI) for researchers, who will be able to choose their needed service, quickly apply it to their given data and research questions and obtain their intended results. Task_area TA1 : research fields The aim of this large task area is to observe at close range the application of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services and then to recommend the development of additional services to satisfy the demands from the various disciplines. TA1 will be supported by a broad range of fields, assisted by coordinators. Task_area TA2 : services, machine learning, big data and data connectivity The operational task area develops and secures the operation of the NFDI4SD\u2019s infrastructure. Using ZENODO utilizes Europe\u2019s largest and renowned research data publication platform and its comprehensive computer power. Task_area TA3 : collaboration tools, user interfaces and publications Today\u2019s research environments are leading to a rising demand for cloud collaboration services. Direct exchange is being replaced by the publication of texts and data. User interfaces ensure that scholars and scientists can effectively use and control data without any special training. In addition, metadata as well as knowledge graphs, advanced catalogues and reference tools will enable users of the NFDI4SD\u2019s services to make the most of open scientific data. Task_area TA4 : standards, metadata and quality assessment Data encoding, flow computers, computer interfaces, APIs and publications require the widest applicable standards, norms and metadata. Our principal investigators (PIs) are long-term members of the key standardization committees and so will ensure the interoperability of the research data over a long period of time. Task_area TA5 : institutions, governance, public outreach, media and literacy The highly experienced and international scientific representatives responsible for this TA will ensure optimal information flow and the smooth undertaking of negotiations and agreements with research institutions worldwide. The organization of virtual conferences, newsletters, blogs, and hopefully of physical meetings in the future, should ensure productive and effective scientific communication and present the research results to the general public. Task_area TA6 : legal aspects Intense scientific collaborative work and the exchange of information, including the production of publications, involve complex legal considerations. This area will be tasked with preparing the operating rules, information desks and consultation services. It will also actively shape the future legal landscape of the research activities of the digital transformation that we are currently undergoing.","title":"Objectives and Task Areas"},{"location":"concept/ObjectiveTask/#summary-of-the-proposed-consortiums-main-objectives-and-task-areas","text":"Digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way researchers work, particularly those working in the small disciplines.

Abstract 2.1 Warum brauchen \u201ekleine F\u00e4cher\" eine NFDI (Arbeitstitel) Im Zuge einer durch die fortschreitende Digitalisierung Transformation des Forschungsprozesses und einer durch die Open-Access-Bewegung befeuerte Verbreitung und Austausch von Forschungsdaten haben sich wissenschaftliche Institutionen wie Universit\u00e4ten, Forschungseinrichtungen aber auch kleinere Gruppen und Akteure zur nachhaltigen Verwaltung und zum interdisziplin\u00e4ren Austausch von Forschungsdaten verpflichtet. Die Initiative zum Aufbau einer Nationalen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur tr\u00e4gt diesen massiven strukturellen Wandel Rechnung. Damit verbunden ist die systematische Planung, Sammlung, Verarbeitung, Analyse, Archivierung, Publikation und der Austausch von Daten unterschiedlichen Typs zur Wiederverwendung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft sowie durch eine breite, interessierte \u00d6ffentlichkeit. Hierbei waren und sind insbesondere Geistes-, Kultur- und Sozialwissenschaften vor neue Herausforderungen gestellt, da Forschungsdatenmanagement und standardisierter Datenaustausch oft weniger selbstverst\u00e4ndlich in ihre disziplin\u00e4re Kultur und Infrastruktur integriert sind, als im Fall der Lebens- oder Naturwissenschaften. Die Forderung nach einer umfassenden Erschlie\u00dfung aber auch einer konsistenten Kontextualisierung wissenschaftlicher Daten ist dabei ein zentrales Anliegen. Hier kann eine Analogie zur Paratext -Debatte 1 der letzten Jahre hergestellt werden: Basierend auf dem von G\u00e9rard Genette (1930--2018) eingef\u00fchrten philologischen Begriff werden Paratexte (unterteilt in Peri- und Epitext ) als jene einem (urspr\u00fcnglich literarischen) Basistext beigef\u00fcgten Elemente bezeichnet, welche Rezeption und Vertrieb eines Werkes entscheidend mitpr\u00e4gen und steuern, darunter Informationen zum Autor, Verlag, Titelei, Vorwort, Dank etc. 2 Dieses Konzept, das gr\u00f6\u00dfere Aufmerksamkeit auf Produktionsprozesse und Autorisierungsinstanzen lenkt, wurde in der weiteren Forschung sukzessive um Textgattungen und Formate neuer Medien erweitert. Im Kontext der Digitalisierung wissenschaftlicher Daten ist ein solches Vorgehen von zentraler Bedeutung: Gerade die Pr\u00fcfung, Autorisierung und nachhaltige Pr\u00e4sentation von Forschungsdaten wird entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Wahrung und Weiterentwicklung nationaler wie internationaler Standards und Qualit\u00e4tsanspr\u00fcche haben und sicherstellen. Die hiermit verbundenen Anforderungen sind jedoch gerade f\u00fcr die sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher eine besondere Herausforderung. Hierzu geh\u00f6ren derzeit deutschlandweit \u00fcber 150 F\u00e4cher, 3 \u00fcberwiegend geistes-, sozial- und kulturwissenschaftliche Disziplinen, die institutionell und ihrem Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis nach keine blo\u00dfen Teildisziplinen eines gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichs darstellen. Die langfristige F\u00f6rderung und Sicherung des Fortbestehens dieser F\u00e4cher stellt ein hochrangiges hochschulpolitisches Ziel f\u00fcr die Lehr- und Forschungsinfrastruktur in Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt dar, wie Bundesbildungsministerin Anja Karliczek betont hat: \u201eAuf die vielen gro\u00dfen Fragen unserer Gesellschaft, nicht zuletzt was sie zusammenh\u00e4lt, geben die Kleinen F\u00e4cher wertvolle Antworten. Sie schaffen bedeutsames Wissen und tragen dazu bei, unser kulturelles Erbe zu bewahren.\" 4 Gleichwohl k\u00f6nnen kleine F\u00e4cher beim Aufbau von modernen Forschungsdateninfrastrukturen nicht oder nicht in notwendigem Umfang auf die Ressourcen jener Institutionen zugreifen, an welche sie i.d.R. organisatorisch angebunden sind. Sie verf\u00fcgen jedoch auch nicht \u00fcber notwendige eigene Mittel und Strukturen, um die spezifischen Bed\u00fcrfnisse ihrer wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft im Hinblick auf modernes Forschungsdatenmanagement zu unterst\u00fctzen, bestehende Praktiken an neue Standards anzupassen und so kompatible, nutzerorientierte Konzepte f\u00fcr Datenaustausch, -sicherung und -wiederverwendung zu implementieren. Wie die vom Bundesbildungsministerium unterst\u00fctzte \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleiner F\u00e4cher\" betont, geh\u00f6rt die Mehrheit der kleinen F\u00e4cher zwar den \u201einsgesamt weniger drittmittelfinanzierten\" Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften an, sie weisen aber (anders als gr\u00f6\u00dfere geistes- und kulturwissenschaftliche F\u00e4cher) eine vergleichsweise \u00fcberdurchschnittliche Drittmittelquote auf -- sowohl hinsichtlich der Anzahl der Antr\u00e4ge wie auch bei den bewilligten Mitteln --, was nicht zuletzt als ein Indikator f\u00fcr einen entsprechend hohen Bedarf angesehen werden kann. Ein weiterer hier zu ber\u00fccksichtigender Faktor ist die besonders kollaborativ und transdisziplin\u00e4r ausgerichtete Arbeitsweise kleiner F\u00e4cher, wie es auch in einem vom BMBF gef\u00f6rderten Projekt zur \u201eDynamik kleiner F\u00e4cher\" betont wird. Davon sind nicht nur Kooperationen mehrerer kleiner und/oder mittelgro\u00dfer F\u00e4chern betroffen, sondern auch die Lehre und die Betreuung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses: Angesichts der thematischen Breite und Methodenvielfalt k\u00f6nnen Forschungsfragen und -themen in kleinen F\u00e4chern -- auch angesichts wissenschaftlicher Spezialisierung -- oftmals nur noch durch Beteiligung mehrerer Fachdisziplinen charakterisiert und angemessen bearbeitet werden: Innovationen werden typischerweise durch disziplinen- und kultur\u00fcbergreifende Arbeit im transnationalen Austausch erreicht und ben\u00f6tigen daher in besonderem Ma\u00dfe die digitale Vernetzung, den Austausch von Forschungsdaten und eine leistungsf\u00e4hige und nutzerfreundliche Infrastruktur, um dieses Ziel zu realisieren und f\u00fcr die Zukunft auszubauen. 2.2 Kleine F\u00e4cher: Formale Kriterien Als Abgrenzung zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichen und Teildisziplinen hat die \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleine F\u00e4cher\" der JGU Mainz Kriterien erarbeitet, die hier als Grundlage zur Bestimmung von Merkmalen, User-Profilen und spezifischen Anforderungen bei der Nutzung von Forschungsdaten herangezogen und erweitert werden sollen. Derzeit geht die Arbeitsstelle von 157 kleinen F\u00e4chern und 2311 Professuren an 89 Standorten bundesweit aus. Diese geh\u00f6ren sechs Fachkulturen an, die sich wiederum in 19 Fachgruppen gliedern: 1) Geisteswissenschaften; 2) Gesundheitswissenschaften; 3) Ingenieurwissenschaften; 4) Kunst- und Kunstwissenschaften; 5) Naturwissenschaften, Agrarwissenschaften und Geographie; 6) Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften. 5 \u00dcber die H\u00e4lfte der kleinen F\u00e4cher geh\u00f6ren den Geisteswissenschaften an, mit einigem Abstand gefolgt von den unter 5) sowie den unter 6) zusammengefassten Fachkulturen. 6 Entscheidend ist in diesem Kontext, dass die spezifischen Interessen vieler der in den Fachkulturen zusammengefassten Fachgruppen bislang nicht oder kaum gesondert angesprochen werden, was nicht zuletzt einer relativ ausgepr\u00e4gten Dynamik geschuldet ist: Neue kleine F\u00e4cher wie Digital Humanities oder Biodiversit\u00e4t etablieren sich, w\u00e4hrend andere aufgrund eines starken Wachstums den Status als kleines Fach verlieren oder aber ganz in gr\u00f6\u00dferen Disziplinen aufgehen. 2.2.1 Institutionelle Ebene Nicht mehr als 3 unbefristete Professuren pro Standort, deutschlandweit sind bis zu 2 Ausnahmen m\u00f6glich: F\u00fcr den jeweiligen Wissenschaftszweig gibt es an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten eigene Professuren mit spezifischen Denominationen. Eigene Studieng\u00e4nge mit qualifiziertem Abschluss: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig ist mit eigenen Studieng\u00e4ngen (Bachelor/ Master/ Magister/ Diplom/ Staatsexamen) an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten vertreten. Die Selektion und Ausbildung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses, d.h., die M\u00f6glichkeit der Promotion sowie die Etablierung von Juniorprofessuren mit der Aussicht auf Verstetigung bzw. Tenure-Track-Verfahren. 2.2.2 Sozial-kommunikative Ebene Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis als eigenes Fach: Die Professoren und Professorinnen, welche den jeweiligen Wissenschaftszweig an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten vertreten, verstehen diesen als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fach. Fachgesellschaft: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eine nationale oder internationale Fachgesellschaft oder wird in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen von einer \u00fcbergeordneten Fachgesellschaft klar als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fach anerkannt. Dies ist nicht zuletzt die Voraussetzung f\u00fcr den Zugang zu F\u00f6rdermitteln verschiedener Institutionen, worauf kleine F\u00e4cher besonders angewiesen sind.

Die Initiative zum Aufbau einer Nationalen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur tr\u00e4gt diesen massiven strukturellen Wandel Rechnung. Damit verbunden ist die systematische Planung, Sammlung, Verarbeitung, Analyse, Archivierung, Publikation und der Austausch von Daten unterschiedlichen Typs zur Wiederverwendung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft sowie durch eine breite, interessierte \u00d6ffentlichkeit. Hierbei waren und sind insbesondere Geistes-, Kultur- und Sozialwissenschaften vor neue Herausforderungen gestellt, da Forschungsdatenmanagement und standardisierter Datenaustausch oft weniger selbstverst\u00e4ndlich in ihre disziplin\u00e4re Kultur und Infrastruktur integriert sind, als im Fall der Lebens- oder Naturwissenschaften. Die Forderung nach einer umfassenden Erschlie\u00dfung aber auch einer konsistenten Kontextualisierung wissenschaftlicher Daten ist dabei ein zentrales Anliegen. Hier kann eine Analogie zur Paratext -Debatte 1 der letzten Jahre hergestellt werden: Basierend auf dem von G\u00e9rard Genette (1930--2018) eingef\u00fchrten philologischen Begriff werden Paratexte (unterteilt in Peri- und Epitext ) als jene einem (urspr\u00fcnglich literarischen) Basistext beigef\u00fcgten Elemente bezeichnet, welche Rezeption und Vertrieb eines Werkes entscheidend mitpr\u00e4gen und steuern, darunter Informationen zum Autor, Verlag, Titelei, Vorwort, Dank etc. 2 Dieses Konzept, das gr\u00f6\u00dfere Aufmerksamkeit auf Produktionsprozesse und Autorisierungsinstanzen lenkt, wurde in der weiteren Forschung sukzessive um Textgattungen und Formate neuer Medien erweitert. Im Kontext der Digitalisierung wissenschaftlicher Daten ist ein solches Vorgehen von zentraler Bedeutung: Gerade die Pr\u00fcfung, Autorisierung und nachhaltige Pr\u00e4sentation von Forschungsdaten wird entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Wahrung und Weiterentwicklung nationaler wie internationaler Standards und Qualit\u00e4tsanspr\u00fcche haben und sicherstellen. Die hiermit verbundenen Anforderungen sind jedoch gerade f\u00fcr die sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher eine besondere Herausforderung. Hierzu geh\u00f6ren derzeit deutschlandweit \u00fcber 150 F\u00e4cher, 3 \u00fcberwiegend geistes-, sozial- und kulturwissenschaftliche Disziplinen, die institutionell und ihrem Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis nach keine blo\u00dfen Teildisziplinen eines gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichs darstellen. Die langfristige F\u00f6rderung und Sicherung des Fortbestehens dieser F\u00e4cher stellt ein hochrangiges hochschulpolitisches Ziel f\u00fcr die Lehr- und Forschungsinfrastruktur in Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt dar, wie Bundesbildungsministerin Anja Karliczek betont hat: \u201eAuf die vielen gro\u00dfen Fragen unserer Gesellschaft, nicht zuletzt was sie zusammenh\u00e4lt, geben die Kleinen F\u00e4cher wertvolle Antworten. Sie schaffen bedeutsames Wissen und tragen dazu bei, unser kulturelles Erbe zu bewahren.\" 4 Gleichwohl k\u00f6nnen kleine F\u00e4cher beim Aufbau von modernen Forschungsdateninfrastrukturen nicht oder nicht in notwendigem Umfang auf die Ressourcen jener Institutionen zugreifen, an welche sie i.d.R. organisatorisch angebunden sind. Sie verf\u00fcgen jedoch auch nicht \u00fcber notwendige eigene Mittel und Strukturen, um die spezifischen Bed\u00fcrfnisse ihrer wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft im Hinblick auf modernes Forschungsdatenmanagement zu unterst\u00fctzen, bestehende Praktiken an neue Standards anzupassen und so kompatible, nutzerorientierte Konzepte f\u00fcr Datenaustausch, -sicherung und -wiederverwendung zu implementieren. Wie die vom Bundesbildungsministerium unterst\u00fctzte \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleiner F\u00e4cher\" betont, geh\u00f6rt die Mehrheit der kleinen F\u00e4cher zwar den \u201einsgesamt weniger drittmittelfinanzierten\" Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften an, sie weisen aber (anders als gr\u00f6\u00dfere geistes- und kulturwissenschaftliche F\u00e4cher) eine vergleichsweise \u00fcberdurchschnittliche Drittmittelquote auf -- sowohl hinsichtlich der Anzahl der Antr\u00e4ge wie auch bei den bewilligten Mitteln --, was nicht zuletzt als ein Indikator f\u00fcr einen entsprechend hohen Bedarf angesehen werden kann. Ein weiterer hier zu ber\u00fccksichtigender Faktor ist die besonders kollaborativ und transdisziplin\u00e4r ausgerichtete Arbeitsweise kleiner F\u00e4cher, wie es auch in einem vom BMBF gef\u00f6rderten Projekt zur \u201eDynamik kleiner F\u00e4cher\" betont wird. Davon sind nicht nur Kooperationen mehrerer kleiner und/oder mittelgro\u00dfer F\u00e4chern betroffen, sondern auch die Lehre und die Betreuung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses: Angesichts der thematischen Breite und Methodenvielfalt k\u00f6nnen Forschungsfragen und -themen in kleinen F\u00e4chern -- auch angesichts wissenschaftlicher Spezialisierung -- oftmals nur noch durch Beteiligung mehrerer Fachdisziplinen charakterisiert und angemessen bearbeitet werden: Innovationen werden typischerweise durch disziplinen- und kultur\u00fcbergreifende Arbeit im transnationalen Austausch erreicht und ben\u00f6tigen daher in besonderem Ma\u00dfe die digitale Vernetzung, den Austausch von Forschungsdaten und eine leistungsf\u00e4hige und nutzerfreundliche Infrastruktur, um dieses Ziel zu realisieren und f\u00fcr die Zukunft auszubauen.","title":"2.1 Warum brauchen \u201ekleine F\u00e4cher\" eine NFDI (Arbeitstitel)"},{"location":"concept/output/#22-kleine-facher-formale-kriterien","text":"Als Abgrenzung zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichen und Teildisziplinen hat die \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleine F\u00e4cher\" der JGU Mainz Kriterien erarbeitet, die hier als Grundlage zur Bestimmung von Merkmalen, User-Profilen und spezifischen Anforderungen bei der Nutzung von Forschungsdaten herangezogen und erweitert werden sollen.

They are therefore not an invention of the digital age. Data catalogs such as Ptolemy's Geography ordered the places and paths of the ancient world, and with the help of his Handy Tables, scholars determined the constellation of the stars. Calendars and associated religious feasts were also based on research data, and encyclopedias standardized not least the understanding and communication of knowledge. Extensive collections of research data created the success of modern scholarship, and modern science, in close interaction with the development of grand theories\u2013but as collaborative joint works, they often did not bear an author's name. Research data is epistemically verified with the greatest care in all academic cultures. They are knowledge assets that are regularly examined to identify errors as quickly as possible and to mark validated data. Thus, research data is not simply information that is disseminated on the Internet in the digital age, linked to other data and openly accessible without regard to its truthfulness. Nor is it \"closed data\", which like an esoteric treasure is only accessible on the basis of privileges. The concept of knowledge was introduced by academia to characterize this special status of information about society and the world. With the generic nature of theory, we can characterize research data as the descriptions of any class of objects that qualify as knowledge or that are pending examination for this status. Research data as knowledge about the properties of research objects with all methodological evaluations by the academic community are distinguished from arbitrary information: Research data are collaboratively, openly and critically examined; they represent a claim of validity that can be revised at any time. The organization of scholarly communication and the ethos in dealing with knowledge is optimized to minimize errors. The established methodological mechanisms should also apply to research data in all disciplines. For the NFDI4SD, this special status of research data in the concert of all academic disciplines - also and especially the so-called small disciplines - is the main focus for the tasks of a future research data infrastructure. RD1 : With Research data scholars and scientists claim fallible knowledge. Research data can be justified and serve as justifying grounds. Research data are open to epistemic qualification. To this end, they must be computationally identified in all times independent of their symbolic form. All epistemic qualification are transparent to the community. With the term \"epistemic qualification\", all additional attributes can be summarized, which are relevant for a distinction and treatment of research data as knowledge. Research data can be distinguished according to the components of the content of the data, its metadata and the epistemic qualification. The content of research data refers to the characteristics of the research objects described by the data. Research data always include both: their content and the additional attributes. Accordingly, an infrastructure of research data must take into account and carefully maintain its integrity. In this context an analogy to the Paratext debate [@zotero-40395] of the last years can be drawn: Based on the philological concept introduced by G\u00e9rard Genette (1930-2018), paratexts (divided into peri- and epitext) are described as those elements added to an (originally literary) basic text which decisively influence and control the reception and distribution of a work. Such elements include information on the author, publisher, title, preface, thanks, etc. [^1] This concept, which draws greater attention to production processes and authorization instances, was successively expanded in further research to include text genres and formats of new media. In the context of the digitization of research data, this means that the verification, authorization and sustainable presentation of research data in particular will have a decisive influence on the maintenance and further development of national and international standards and quality requirements. \u200b RD2 : Research-data are a composit of data-content, metadata and epistemic attributes. It unifies all those information about data-sources like texts including their paratexts. Their composition will adhere epistemic principles enhancing the requirements of obtaining, accessing and maintaining scientific knowledge. As of the 1920s, the physicist and philosopher Hans Reichenbach distinguished the context of discovery from the context of justification for the critical evaluation of statements. The context of discovery takes into account causes that lead to a new insight and assessment of scientific facts. The reasons for the justification of statements must be separated from this - regardless of whether they are theoretical hypotheses or the content of research data. From the perspective of the researchers who are searching for new answers and who create and use research data for this purpose, the focus is on the discovery context. In doing so, they overlook the fact that even a discovery process is always based on knowledge that has already been justified. Research data are validated particularly carefully if they are versioned for publication during the research process. \u200b RD3 : The value of research data must always be assessed from the perspective of further use by others, and not from the perspective of the first person in the discovery process. The justification of knowledge - and thus the validity of research data - is always a collaborative task of the entire research community. Therefore, the research data infrastructure must provide the means to trace the provenance of research data and epistemic dependence on third parties. This is rarely guaranteed at present. \u200b RD4: The justification of the data by other research data should be as transparent and comprehensible as possible. A \"dependency graph\" can show the relation of the research data to other research data and thus clarify the epistemic dependencies among each other. It should be recognizable on which academic assumptions the validity of research data depends. Within an innovative research organization, it follows that newly acquired data must be made available to other academics as quickly and completely as possible with regard to their epistemic qualification. This act of transferring research data from the hands of the individual researchers working in the discovery context to the public deserves its own, special term: the academic publication. \u200b RD5: Publication. Publishing of research data is the act of handing over to the academic community compiled findings of data in the discovery context. Only then do results become justifiable knowledge. The status of research data is given to empirical findings only through publication. Research data publication leads to citable data sets, which are listed in a bibliography by other authors like current research literature. The latter principle consequently leads to the publication of research data being considered in the management plan as early as possible. A strict sequence of processes, in which the publication of research data is planned only after the completion of one project after all other completed activities, is thus not reasonable from the point of view of academic theory and is detrimental to an innovative research. The data publication and the innovative data citation will lead to research projects gaining a high level of visibility and the own data publication will significantly increase the impact of the project and the people involved in it. RD6: Citing research data. Use of research data for other data or in textual publication should cite the origin. Citing research data should be listed in bibliographies or lists of references like any other scholarly source. Its publication format resembles the reference styles like any other bibliographical source. Citations can be managed and administered in citation databases or tools. During the course of research projects, many research data are created in relation to other data. The new data are annotated, linked or otherwise needed for further research. The scope of these research data is huge, yet they are currently only published to a small extent. These data sets considerably increase the usefulness of the data associated with them. \u200b RD7: Enhancing research data. Modern research projects create rich additional research data during the research process. Institutional consequences: FAIR use We understand the FAIR principles as requirements for an infrastructure that has to serve the status of research data as a knowledge base for a collaborative, open science. In order to create these conditions, international research associations and institutions committed themselves to the implementation of the FAIR principles. Increasingly, funding institutions link the allocation of funds to fulfilled FAIR conditions. Today, however, these conditions cannot be guaranteed by researchers alone: Especially agile research projects in small disciplines do not have the resources to meet the special requirements of providing and using research data. This will in future depend on a research-based infrastructure. From the many implementations of the FAIR principles we follow the proposals of the GO FAIR initiative.

Data catalogs such as Ptolemy's Geography ordered the places and paths of the ancient world, and with the help of his Handy Tables, scholars determined the constellation of the stars. Calendars and associated religious feasts were also based on research data, and encyclopedias standardized not least the understanding and communication of knowledge. Extensive collections of research data created the success of modern scholarship, and modern science, in close interaction with the development of grand theories\u2013but as collaborative joint works, they often did not bear an author's name. Research data is epistemically verified with the greatest care in all academic cultures. They are knowledge assets that are regularly examined to identify errors as quickly as possible and to mark validated data. Thus, research data is not simply information that is disseminated on the Internet in the digital age, linked to other data and openly accessible without regard to its truthfulness. Nor is it \"closed data\", which like an esoteric treasure is only accessible on the basis of privileges. The concept of knowledge was introduced by academia to characterize this special status of information about society and the world. With the generic nature of theory, we can characterize research data as the descriptions of any class of objects that qualify as knowledge or that are pending examination for this status.

Auch Kalender und damit verbundene religi\u00f6se Feste orientierten sich an Forschungsdaten, und Lexika normierten nicht zuletzt das Fachverst\u00e4ndnis und die Kommunikation von Wissen. Umfangreiche Sammlungen von Forschungsdaten schufen den Erfolg der Wissenschaft im engen Zusammenspiel mit der Entwicklung gro\u00dfer Theorien \u2013 doch sie trugen als kollaborative Gemeinschaftswerke h\u00e4ufig keinen Autorennamen. Forschungsdaten werden in allen Wissenschaftskulturen mit gr\u00f6\u00dfter Sorgfalt epistemisch gepr\u00fcft. Es sind Wissensbest\u00e4nde, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig untersucht werden, um Irrt\u00fcmer m\u00f6glichst schnell zu identifizieren und validierte Daten auszuzeichnen.

Forschungsdaten als Wissen \u00fcber die Eigenschaften von Forschungsobjekten mit allen methodischen Bewertungen durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft werden dabei von beliebigen Informationen unterschieden: Forschungsdaten werden kollaborativ, offen und kritisch gepr\u00fcft; mit ihnen wird ein Geltungsanspruch vertreten, der jederzeit revidiert werden kann. Die Organisation wissenschaftlicher Kommunikation und das Ethos im Umgang mit Wissen ist daraufhin optimiert, Irrt\u00fcmer zu minimieren.

Research data can be justified and serve as justifying grounds. Research data are open to epistemic qualification. For this they must be computationally identified in all times independent of their symbolic form. All epistemic qualification are transparent to the community. Mit dem Begriff \"epistemic qualification\" k\u00f6nnen alle zus\u00e4tzlichen Attribute zusammengefasst werden, die f\u00fcr eine Auszeichnung und Behandlung von Forschungsdaten als Wissen relevant sind. Forschungsdaten lassen sich nach den Komponenten des Gehalts der Daten, ihrer Metadaten und der epistemischen Qualifikation unterscheiden. Der Gehalt der Forschungsdaten meint die von den Daten beschriebenen Eigenschaften der Forschungsgegenst\u00e4nde. Forschungsdaten umfassen immer beides: ihren Gehalt und die zus\u00e4tzlichen Attribute. Eine Infrastruktur von Forschungsdaten muss entsprechend ihre Integrit\u00e4t ber\u00fccksichtigen und sorgsam beibehalten. Hier kann eine Analogie zur Paratext -Debatte [@zotero-40395] der letzten Jahre hergestellt werden: Basierend auf dem von G\u00e9rard Genette (1930\u20132018) eingef\u00fchrten philologischen Begriff werden Paratexte (unterteilt in Peri- und Epitext ) als jene einem (urspr\u00fcnglich literarischen) Basistext beigef\u00fcgten Elemente bezeichnet, welche Rezeption und Vertrieb eines Werkes entscheidend mitpr\u00e4gen und steuern, darunter Informationen zum Autor, Verlag, Titelei, Vorwort, Dank etc. 4 Dieses Konzept, das gr\u00f6\u00dfere Aufmerksamkeit auf Produktionsprozesse und Autorisierungsinstanzen lenkt, wurde in der weiteren Forschung sukzessive um Textgattungen und Formate neuer Medien erweitert. Im Kontext der Digitalisierung wissenschaftlicher Daten hei\u00dft das: Gerade die Pr\u00fcfung, Autorisierung und nachhaltige Pr\u00e4sentation von Forschungsdaten wird entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Wahrung und Weiterentwicklung nationaler wie internationaler Standards und Qualit\u00e4tsanspr\u00fcche haben. research data RD2 : Research-data are a composit of data-content, metadata and epistemic attributes. It unifies all those information about data-sources like texts including their paratexts. Their composition will adhere epistemic principles enhancing the requirements of obtaining, accessing and maintaining scientific knowledge. Der Physiker und Philosoph Hans Reichenbach unterschied ab den 1920er-Jahren f\u00fcr die wissenschaftliche Beurteilung von Aussagen den Entdeckungszusammenhang vom Rechtfertigungszusammenhang. Der Entdeckungszusammenhang ber\u00fccksichtigt Gr\u00fcnde, die zu einer neuen Einsicht und Beurteilung wissenschaftlicher Sachverhalte f\u00fchren. Davon zu trennen sind die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr die Rechtfertigung von Aussagen \u2013 unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob es sich um theoretische Hypothesen oder den Gehalt von Forschungsdaten handelt. Aus der Perspektive der Forscher, die auf der Suche nach wissenschaftlichen Antworten sind und dazu Forschungsdaten erstellen und weiternutzen, steht der Entdeckungszusammenhang im Vordergrund. Dabei wird \u00fcbersehen, dass auch ein Entdeckungsprozess immer wieder auf auf bereits gerechtfertigtes Wissen st\u00fctzt. Forschungsdaten werden besonders sorgf\u00e4ltig validiert, wenn sie bereits w\u00e4hrend des Forschungsprozesses versioniert f\u00fcr die Publikation bearbeitet werden. research data RD3 : Der Wert von Forschungsdaten muss immer aus der Perspektive des weiteren Nutzens durch andere beurteilt werden, und nicht aus der Perspektive der ersten Person im Entdeckungsprozess. Die Rechtfertigung von Wissen \u2013 und damit um Geltung von Forschungsdaten \u2013 ist immer eine kollaborative Aufgabe der gesamten Forschungsgemeinschaft. Die Forschungsdateninfrastruktur muss deshalb f\u00fcr Mittel sorgen, mit denen die Provenienz der Forschungsdaten und epistemische Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten von Dritten nachvollzogen werden k\u00f6nnen.

Es soll erkennbar sein, von welchen wissenschaftlichen Annahmen die Geltung von Forschungsdaten abh\u00e4ngt. Innerhalb einer innovativen Wissenschaftsorganisation folgt daraus f\u00fcr neu gewonnene Forschungsdaten, dass diese m\u00f6glichst schnell und vollst\u00e4ndig hinsichtlich ihrer epistemischen Qualifikation anderen Forscherinnen und Forschern zug\u00e4nglich gemacht weren m\u00fcssen.

Eine sequentielle Abfolge von Prozessen, die eine Publikation von Forschungsdaten erst nach Abschlu\u00df eines Projektes nach allen anderen abgeschlossenen T\u00e4tigkeit vorsieht, ist somit wissenschaftstheoretisch unvern\u00fcnftig und schadet einer innovativen Wissenschaft. Die Datenpublikation und die innovative Datenzitation werden dazu f\u00fchren, dass Forschungsprojekte eine gro\u00dfe wissenchaftliche Sichtbarkeit erlangen und die eigenen Datenpublikation den Impact des Projektes und der daran Beteiligten wesentlich steigern. research data RD6 Citing research data.

Sie sind damit keine Erfindung des digitalen Zeitalters. Datenkataloge wie Ptolemy\u2019s Geography haben die Orte und Wege der antiken Welt geordnet, und mithilfe seiner Handy Tables bestimmten Gelehrte die Konstellation der Gestirne. Auch Kalender und damit verbundene religi\u00f6se Feste orientierten sich an Forschungsdaten, und Lexika normierten nicht zuletzt das Fachverst\u00e4ndnis und die Kommunikation von Wissen. Umfangreiche Sammlungen von Forschungsdaten schufen den Erfolg der Wissenschaft im engen Zusammenspiel mit der Entwicklung gro\u00dfer Theorien \u2013 doch sie trugen als kollaborative Gemeinschaftswerke h\u00e4ufig keinen Autorennamen. Forschungsdaten werden in allen Wissenschaftskulturen mit gr\u00f6\u00dfter Sorgfalt epistemisch gepr\u00fcft. Es sind Wissensbest\u00e4nde, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig untersucht werden, um Irrt\u00fcmer m\u00f6glichst schnell zu identifizieren und validierte Daten auszuzeichnen. Forschungsdaten sind demnach nicht einfach Informationen, die im digitalen Zeitalter im Internet verbreitet, mit anderen Daten verlinkt und offen zug\u00e4nglich ohne Ansehen ihres Wahrheitsgehalts weiter genutzt werden. Es handelt sich auch nicht um \u201cclosed data\u201d, die wie ein esoterischer Schatz nur auf Basis von Privilegien zug\u00e4nglich sind. Die Wissenschaft hat den Begriff des Wissens eingef\u00fchrt, um diesen besonderen Status von Informationen \u00fcber Gesellschaft und Welt zu kennzeichnen. Mit wissenschaftstheoretischer Allgemeinheit k\u00f6nnen wir Forschungsdaten als die Beschreibungen von Gegenstandsklassen jeder Art charakterisieren, die als Wissen qualifiziert werden oder deren Pr\u00fcfung auf diesen Status aussteht. Forschungsdaten als Wissen \u00fcber die Eigenschaften von Forschungsobjekten mit allen methodischen Bewertungen durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft werden dabei von beliebigen Informationen unterschieden: Forschungsdaten werden kollaborativ, offen und kritisch gepr\u00fcft; mit ihnen wird ein Geltungsanspruch vertreten, der jederzeit revidiert werden kann. Die Organisation wissenschaftlicher Kommunikation und das Ethos im Umgang mit Wissen ist daraufhin optimiert, Irrt\u00fcmer zu minimieren. Die etablierten methodologischen Mechanismen sollten auch f\u00fcr Forschungsdaten in allen Wissenschaften gelten. F\u00fcr das NFDI4SD ist dieser besondere Status von Forschungsdaten im Konzert aller wissenschaftlicher Disziplinen \u2013 auch und besonders der sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher \u2013 Hauptaugenmerk f\u00fcr die Aufgaben einer zuk\u00fcnftigen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur. research data RD1 : With Research data scholars and scientists claim fallible knowledge. Research data can be justified and serve as justifying grounds. Research data are open to epistemic qualification. For this they must be computationally identified in all times independent of their symbolic form. All epistemic qualification are transparent to the community. Mit dem Begriff \"epistemic qualification\" k\u00f6nnen alle zus\u00e4tzlichen Attribute zusammengefasst werden, die f\u00fcr eine Auszeichnung und Behandlung von Forschungsdaten als Wissen relevant sind. Forschungsdaten lassen sich nach den Komponenten des Gehalts der Daten, ihrer Metadaten und der epistemischen Qualifikation unterscheiden. Der Gehalt der Forschungsdaten meint die von den Daten beschriebenen Eigenschaften der Forschungsgegenst\u00e4nde. Forschungsdaten umfassen immer beides: ihren Gehalt und die zus\u00e4tzlichen Attribute. Eine Infrastruktur von Forschungsdaten muss entsprechend ihre Integrit\u00e4t ber\u00fccksichtigen und sorgsam beibehalten. Hier kann eine Analogie zur Paratext -Debatte [@zotero-40395] der letzten Jahre hergestellt werden: Basierend auf dem von G\u00e9rard Genette (1930\u20132018) eingef\u00fchrten philologischen Begriff werden Paratexte (unterteilt in Peri- und Epitext ) als jene einem (urspr\u00fcnglich literarischen) Basistext beigef\u00fcgten Elemente bezeichnet, welche Rezeption und Vertrieb eines Werkes entscheidend mitpr\u00e4gen und steuern, darunter Informationen zum Autor, Verlag, Titelei, Vorwort, Dank etc. 4 Dieses Konzept, das gr\u00f6\u00dfere Aufmerksamkeit auf Produktionsprozesse und Autorisierungsinstanzen lenkt, wurde in der weiteren Forschung sukzessive um Textgattungen und Formate neuer Medien erweitert. Im Kontext der Digitalisierung wissenschaftlicher Daten hei\u00dft das: Gerade die Pr\u00fcfung, Autorisierung und nachhaltige Pr\u00e4sentation von Forschungsdaten wird entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Wahrung und Weiterentwicklung nationaler wie internationaler Standards und Qualit\u00e4tsanspr\u00fcche haben. research data RD2 : Research-data are a composit of data-content, metadata and epistemic attributes. It unifies all those information about data-sources like texts including their paratexts. Their composition will adhere epistemic principles enhancing the requirements of obtaining, accessing and maintaining scientific knowledge. Der Physiker und Philosoph Hans Reichenbach unterschied ab den 1920er-Jahren f\u00fcr die wissenschaftliche Beurteilung von Aussagen den Entdeckungszusammenhang vom Rechtfertigungszusammenhang. Der Entdeckungszusammenhang ber\u00fccksichtigt Gr\u00fcnde, die zu einer neuen Einsicht und Beurteilung wissenschaftlicher Sachverhalte f\u00fchren. Davon zu trennen sind die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr die Rechtfertigung von Aussagen \u2013 unabh\u00e4ngig davon, ob es sich um theoretische Hypothesen oder den Gehalt von Forschungsdaten handelt. Aus der Perspektive der Forscher, die auf der Suche nach wissenschaftlichen Antworten sind und dazu Forschungsdaten erstellen und weiternutzen, steht der Entdeckungszusammenhang im Vordergrund. Dabei wird \u00fcbersehen, dass auch ein Entdeckungsprozess immer wieder auf auf bereits gerechtfertigtes Wissen st\u00fctzt. Forschungsdaten werden besonders sorgf\u00e4ltig validiert, wenn sie bereits w\u00e4hrend des Forschungsprozesses versioniert f\u00fcr die Publikation bearbeitet werden. research data RD3 : Der Wert von Forschungsdaten muss immer aus der Perspektive des weiteren Nutzens durch andere beurteilt werden, und nicht aus der Perspektive der ersten Person im Entdeckungsprozess. Die Rechtfertigung von Wissen \u2013 und damit um Geltung von Forschungsdaten \u2013 ist immer eine kollaborative Aufgabe der gesamten Forschungsgemeinschaft. Die Forschungsdateninfrastruktur muss deshalb f\u00fcr Mittel sorgen, mit denen die Provenienz der Forschungsdaten und epistemische Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten von Dritten nachvollzogen werden k\u00f6nnen. Gerade dies ist derzeit selten gew\u00e4hrleistet. research data RD4 : Die Rechtfertigung der Daten durch andere Forschungsdaten soll m\u00f6glichst transparent und nachvollziehbar sein. Ein \"dependency graph\" kann die Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der Forschungsdaten von anderen Forschungsdaten aufzeigen und damit die epistemischen Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten untereinander verdeutlichen. Es soll erkennbar sein, von welchen wissenschaftlichen Annahmen die Geltung von Forschungsdaten abh\u00e4ngt. Innerhalb einer innovativen Wissenschaftsorganisation folgt daraus f\u00fcr neu gewonnene Forschungsdaten, dass diese m\u00f6glichst schnell und vollst\u00e4ndig hinsichtlich ihrer epistemischen Qualifikation anderen Forscherinnen und Forschern zug\u00e4nglich gemacht weren m\u00fcssen. Dieser Akt der \u00dcbergabe von Forschungsdaten aus den H\u00e4nden der im Entdeckungszusammenhang arbeitenden Forschenden in die wissenschaftliche \u00d6ffentlichkeit verdient einen eigenen, besonderen Begriff: die wissenschaftliche Publikation . research data RD5 : Publication. Die Publikation von Forschungsdaten ist der Akt der \u00dcbergabe von erstellten Befunden von Daten im Entdeckungszusammenhang an die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft. Erst dadurch werden Ergebnisse zu rechtfertigbarem Wissen. Den Status von research data erhalten empirische Befunde erst durch die wissenschaftliche Publikation. Datenpublikation f\u00fchren zu zitierf\u00e4higen Datenbest\u00e4nden, die von anderen Forschenden wie die derzeitige Forschungsliteratur in einer Bibliographie gelistet wird. Das letztgenannte Prinzip f\u00fchrt in der Konsequenz dazu, die Forschungsdatenpublikation m\u00f6glichst rechtzeitig im Managementplan zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Eine sequentielle Abfolge von Prozessen, die eine Publikation von Forschungsdaten erst nach Abschlu\u00df eines Projektes nach allen anderen abgeschlossenen T\u00e4tigkeit vorsieht, ist somit wissenschaftstheoretisch unvern\u00fcnftig und schadet einer innovativen Wissenschaft. Die Datenpublikation und die innovative Datenzitation werden dazu f\u00fchren, dass Forschungsprojekte eine gro\u00dfe wissenchaftliche Sichtbarkeit erlangen und die eigenen Datenpublikation den Impact des Projektes und der daran Beteiligten wesentlich steigern. research data RD6 Citing research data. The reuse of research data for other data or in textual publication should cite the origin. Citing research data should be listed in bibliographies or lists of references like any other scholarly source. Its publication format resembles the reference styles like any other bibliographical source. Citations can be managed and administered in citation databases or tools. W\u00e4hrend der Laufzeit von Forschungsprojekten entstehen viele Forschungsdaten zu anderen Daten. Die neuen Daten annotieren, verlinken oder werden in anderer Hinsicht f\u00fcr den weiteren Verlauf der Forschungen ben\u00f6tigt. Der Umfang dieser Forschungsdaten ist riesig, und dennoch werden sie derzeit nur in geringem Umfang selbst publiziert.

The progressing digitalization and the Open Access movement have led to a transformation of the research process and resulted in a broader dissemination of research data. In the course of this development, academic institutions such as universities, research institutes, but also smaller groups and agents have committed themselves to the sustainable management and interdisciplinary exchange of research data. The initiative to establish a National Research Data Infrastructure reflects this massive structural change. This involves the systematic planning, collection, processing, analysis, archiving, publication and exchange of data of various types for reuse by the scientific community and a broader interested public. The Humanities, Cultural Studies and Social Sciences in particular have been and continue to be faced with new challenges in this regard, since research data management and standardized data exchange are often less naturally integrated into their disciplinary culture and infrastructure than in the case of the Life Sciences or Natural Sciences. The challenges associated with these tasks are particularly difficult to master in the so-called small disciplines. These currently include over 150 disciplines throughout Germany, predominantly Humanities, Social and Cultural Sciences, which, institutionally and in terms of self-understanding, are not mere sub-disciplines of a larger discipline. The long-term funding and guarantee of the long-term sustainability of these disciplines is a high-ranking objective of German education and research infrastructure as a whole, as Federal Minister of Education and Research Anja Karliczek emphasized: \"The small disciplines provide valuable answers to the many major questions facing our society, not least of all what holds it together. They create significant knowledge and contribute to the preservation of our cultural heritage\". Examples \"small disciplines\" Book Studies Digital Humanities Sinology Public Health Near Eastern Archaeology Cartography History of Science East European Studies Music Pedagogy Numismatics Geochemistry Medieval Latin Museology Science and Technology Studies Turkish Studies Ethics of medicine Japanology Mining Studies At the same time, small disciplines do not have access to the resources of the institutions to which they are usually organizationally linked, or cannot access them to the extent necessary when setting up modern research data infrastructures. However, they also do not posses the necessary resources and structures of their own to support the specific needs of their academic community with regard to modern research data management, to adapt existing practices to new standards, and thus to implement compatible, user-oriented concepts for data exchange, backup and reuse. As the \"Arbeitsstelle Kleiner F\u00e4cher\" supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research emphasizes, although the majority of small subjects belong to the Humanities and Cultural Studies, which are \"altogether less externally funded\", they have a comparatively above-average proportion of third-party funding (unlike major subjects in the Humanities and Cultural Studies). This is the case both in terms of the number of applications and the approved funds\u2013which can be seen not least as an indicator of a correspondingly high demand. At present, there is no standardized higher education policy framework for the promotion of small subjects in Germany: In some states, special programs have been initiated, in others there are no measures at all; these are supplemented by funding offers from the respective professional associations or foundations. A further factor to be considered here is the particularly collaborative and transdisciplinary approach to small subjects, as is also being investigated in a BMBF-funded research project on the \"Dynamics of small subjects\" from 2019 to 2022. This not only concerns collaborations between several small and/or medium-sized subjects, but also the teaching and supervision of young researchers. Given the breadth of topics and variety of methods, research questions and topics in small subjects can often only be characterized and adequately addressed through the participation of several disciplines: Innovations are typically achieved through cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural work in transnational exchange and therefore particularly require digital networking, the exchange of research data and a powerful and user-friendly infrastructure in order to realize this goal and expand it for the future. Small disciplines: formal criteria In order to differentiate small subjects from larger departments and sub-disciplines, the \"Small Subjects Unit\" at JGU Mainz has developed criteria, which will be used and expanded in the following as a basis for determining characteristics, user profiles and specific requirements for the use of research data. At present, the center assumes 157 small subjects and 2311 professorships at 89 locations nationwide. These belong to six disciplinary cultures, which in turn are divided into 19 sections: 1) Humanities; 2) Health Sciences; 3) Engineering and Technology; 4) Arts and Humanities; 5) Natural Sciences, Agricultural Sciences and Geography; 6) Law, Economics and Social Sciences. More than half of the small disciplines belong to the Humanities, followed at some distance by the disciplines summarized under 5) and those summarized under 6). A decisive factor in this context is that the specific interests of many of the disciplines grouped together in the disciplinary cultures have so far not been addressed separately, if at all, which is due not least to a relatively pronounced dynamic in the field: New small disciplines such as Digital Humanities or Biodiversity are establishing themselves, while others are losing their status as \"small\" disciplines due to strong growth or are being absorbed into larger disciplines. The formal requirements for belonging to the small disciplines are the number of no more than three permanent professorships per location; up to two exceptions are possible throughout Germany. The respective discipline has its own professorships with specific denominations. Separate study programs with qualified degrees: The respective academic discipline is represented at German universities with its own study programs (Bachelor's/Master's/Magister's/ Diplom/ Staatsexamen). The selection and training of young academics, i.e., the possibility of obtaining a doctorate as well as the establishment of junior professorships with the prospect of permanent or tenure-track positions. Social and communicative criteria Small disciplines no longer cooperate and communicate only on a project-oriented basis, but generally have an international and collaborative focus in order to meet the specific research requirements that are thematically and structurally determined. At the same time, they also have a distinct communication structure and suitable forms of media as well as a mindset that is recognizable to the public. This includes the self-conception as a subject in its own right: The professors who represent the respective branch of academic study at German universities see it as an independent subject. Representation by a learned society: The respective branch of knowledge is represented by a national or international learned society or, in exceptional cases, is clearly recognized as an independent subject by a superordinate society. This is not least a requirement for access to funding from various institutions, which small disciplines are particularly dependent on. Professional journals and other communication organs: The respective academic discipline has its own national or international pertinent publication organs. Target groups and their requirements It is the declared goal of the NFDI4SD to provide an infrastructure and services for all small disciplines and the academic cultures and groups represented by them and to support them in the implementation of their individual goals and projects in terms of sustainable research data management. A service structure that can be assembled modularly according to the respective needs and requirements will help in this process. The different professional, communication and publication cultures of scholars and scientists (in the following referred to as users, agents or researchers) must be taken into account and should not be restricted by static, inflexible conditions and processes. The sociologist Rudolf Stichweh described academic disciplines in the context of differentiation and de-differentiation movements in 2019 as highly dynamic communication systems: The increasing problem orientation and project planning of modern research is thus further intensified by digitization, but also by new demands on professional qualifications. The NFDI4SD consortium will therefore deliberately incorporate researchers from various disciplines and interested institutions into the development process of the new infrastructure, including the use of social media, the development, dissemination and evaluation of questionnaires on the desired service offering, and the tendering and funding of pilot projects. The knowledge and experience gained will be incorporated into the establishment and development process of the NFDI4SD and will be evaluated successively. The aim is to offer and implement the reusability of research data by means of various strategies for handling them, as otherwise these data will be lost to the general public due to a lack of resources\u2013whether time, know-how or financial means. At this point, another characteristic of the NFDI4SD becomes clear: projects at different stages of development, of varying sizes and with varying funding periods are explicitly addressed, from qualification projects such as theses and dissertations to larger research groups in institutions or universities. Especially in the case of doctoral theses, in many disciplines the final publication of research results has so far been the primary indicator of the success of a research project, while underlying data are not contextualized and systematically indexed. Thus, the latter cannot be cited by others or would have to be reworked for this purpose. In more extensive interdisciplinary research projects and collaborations, the insights and partial results gained through communication and evaluation from different perspectives are of particular importance. This facilitates the publication of research data and partial results, which consequently develop a stronger dynamic and relevance for the overall research process.

Wie die vom Bundesbildungsministerium unterst\u00fctzte \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleiner F\u00e4cher\" betont, geh\u00f6rt die Mehrheit der kleinen F\u00e4cher zwar den \u201einsgesamt weniger drittmittelfinanzierten\" Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften an, sie weisen aber (anders als gr\u00f6\u00dfere geistes- und kulturwissenschaftliche F\u00e4cher) eine vergleichsweise \u00fcberdurchschnittliche Drittmittelquote auf \u2013 sowohl hinsichtlich der Anzahl der Antr\u00e4ge wie auch bei den bewilligten Mitteln \u2013, was nicht zuletzt als ein Indikator f\u00fcr einen entsprechend hohen Bedarf angesehen werden kann. 3 Derzeit gibt es keine einheitlichen hochschulpolitischen Rahmenbedingungen f\u00fcr die F\u00f6rderung kleiner F\u00e4cher: In manchen Bundesl\u00e4ndern wurden entsprechende spezielle Programme initiiert, in anderen gibt es keinerlei Ma\u00dfnahmen; erg\u00e4nzt durch F\u00f6rderangebote der jeweiligen Fachgesellschaften oder durch Stiftungen. 4 Ein weiterer hier zu ber\u00fccksichtigender Faktor ist die besonders kollaborativ und transdisziplin\u00e4r ausgerichtete Arbeitsweise kleiner F\u00e4cher, wie es auch im Rahmen eines vom BMBF gef\u00f6rderten Forschungsprojekt zur \u201eDynamik kleiner F\u00e4cher\" von 2019 bis 2022 untersucht wird. 5 Davon sind nicht nur Kooperationen mehrerer kleiner und/oder mittelgro\u00dfer F\u00e4chern betroffen, sondern auch die Lehre und die Betreuung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses: Angesichts der thematischen Breite und Methodenvielfalt k\u00f6nnen Forschungsfragen und -themen in kleinen F\u00e4chern oftmals nur noch durch Beteiligung mehrerer Fachdisziplinen charakterisiert und angemessen bearbeitet werden: Innovationen werden typischerweise durch disziplinen- und kultur\u00fcbergreifende Arbeit im transnationalen Austausch erreicht und ben\u00f6tigen daher in besonderem Ma\u00dfe die digitale Vernetzung, den Austausch von Forschungsdaten und eine leistungsf\u00e4hige und nutzerfreundliche Infrastruktur, um dieses Ziel zu realisieren und f\u00fcr die Zukunft auszubauen. Kleine F\u00e4cher: Formale Kriterien In Abgrenzung zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichen und Teildisziplinen hat die \u201eArbeitsstelle Kleine F\u00e4cher\" der JGU Mainz Kriterien erarbeitet, 8 die im Folgenden als Grundlage zur Bestimmung von Merkmalen, User-Profilen und spezifischen Anforderungen bei der Nutzung von Forschungsdaten herangezogen und erweitert werden sollen. Derzeit geht die Arbeitsstelle von 157 kleinen F\u00e4chern und 2311 Professuren an 89 Standorten bundesweit aus. Diese geh\u00f6ren sechs Fachkulturen an, die sich wiederum in 19 Fachgruppen gliedern: 1) Geisteswissenschaften; 2) Gesundheitswissenschaften; 3) Ingenieurwissenschaften; 4) Kunst- und Kunstwissenschaften; 5) Naturwissenschaften, Agrarwissenschaften und Geographie; 6) Rechts-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften. 6 \u00dcber die H\u00e4lfte der kleinen F\u00e4cher geh\u00f6ren den Geisteswissenschaften an, mit einigem Abstand gefolgt von den unter 5) sowie den unter 6) zusammengefassten Fachkulturen. 7 Entscheidend ist in diesem Kontext, dass die spezifischen Interessen vieler der in den Fachkulturen zusammengefassten Fachgruppen bislang nicht oder kaum gesondert angesprochen werden, was nicht zuletzt einer relativ ausgepr\u00e4gten Dynamik im Feld geschuldet ist: Neue kleine F\u00e4cher wie Digital Humanities oder Biodiversit\u00e4t etablieren sich, w\u00e4hrend andere aufgrund eines starken Wachstums den Status als kleines Fach verlieren oder aber ganz in gr\u00f6\u00dferen Disziplinen aufgehen. Als Voraussetzungen gelten hierbei eine Zahl von nicht mehr als drei unbefristete Professuren pro Standort, deutschlandweit sind bis zu zwei Ausnahmen m\u00f6glich. F\u00fcr den jeweiligen Wissenschaftszweig gibt es an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten eigene Professuren mit spezifischen Denominationen. Eigene Studieng\u00e4nge mit qualifiziertem Abschluss: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig ist mit eigenen Studieng\u00e4ngen (Bachelor/ Master/Magister/ Diplom/ Staatsexamen) an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten vertreten. Die Selektion und Ausbildung des wissenschaftlichen Nachwuchses, d.h., die M\u00f6glichkeit der Promotion sowie die Etablierung von Juniorprofessuren mit der Aussicht auf Verstetigung bzw. Tenure-Track-Verfahren. Sozial-kommunikative Ebene Kleine F\u00e4cher kooperieren und kommunizieren nicht mehr nur projektbezogen, sondern sind generell international und kollaborativ ausgerichtet, um den thematisch-strukturell bedingten besonderen Forschungsanforderungen gerecht zu werden. Gleichwohl verf\u00fcgen sie auch \u00fcber eine spezifische Kommunikationsstruktur und daf\u00fcr geeignete Medien sowie ein f\u00fcr die \u00d6ffentlichkeit erkennbares Mindset. Hierzu geh\u00f6rt das Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis als eigenes Fach: Die Professoren und Professorinnen, welche den jeweiligen Wissenschaftszweig an deutschen Universit\u00e4ten vertreten, verstehen diesen als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fach. Vertretung durch eine Fachgesellschaft: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eine nationale oder internationale Fachgesellschaft oder wird in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen von einer \u00fcbergeordneten Fachgesellschaft klar als eigenst\u00e4ndiges Fach anerkannt. Dies ist nicht zuletzt die Voraussetzung f\u00fcr den Zugang zu F\u00f6rdermitteln verschiedener Institutionen, worauf kleine F\u00e4cher besonders angewiesen sind. Fachzeitschriften und weitere Kommunikationsorgane: Der jeweilige Wissenschaftszweig verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eigene nationale oder internationale einschl\u00e4gige Publikationsorgane. Zielgruppen und Bed\u00fcrfnisse Es ist erkl\u00e4rtes Ziel des NFDI4SD, eine Infrastruktur und Services f\u00fcr s\u00e4mtliche kleinen F\u00e4cher und die durch sie vertretenen Fachkulturen und -gruppen bereitzustellen und diese in der Umsetzung ihrer individuellen Ziele und Projekte im Sinne eines entwicklungsf\u00e4higen Forschungsdatenmanagements zu unterst\u00fctzen. Dabei soll eine Servicestruktur helfen, die modular nach den jeweiligen Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anforderungen zusammengestellt werden kann. Die unterschiedliche Fach-, Kommunikations und Publikationskultur von scholars wie scientists (im Folgenden verbindend als user, agents oder researcher bezeichnet) muss entsprechend Ber\u00fccksichtigung finden und soll nicht durch statische, unflexible Rahmenbedingungen und Abl\u00e4ufe eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden. So beschrieb auch der Wissenschaftssoziologe Rudolf Stichweh wissenschaftliche Disziplinen im Kontext von Differenzierungs- und Entdifferenzierungsbewegungen 2019 als hoch dynamische Kommunikationssysteme: Die zunehmende Problemorientierung und Projektierung moderner Wissenschaft wird demzufolge durch die Digitalisierung, aber auch neue Anforderungen an berufliche Qualifikation weiter verst\u00e4rkt. 9 Das Konsortium NFDI4SD wird Forscherinnen, Forscher unterschiedicher Disziplinen sowie interessierter Institutionen daher ganz bewusst in den Entwicklungsprozess der neuen Infrastruktur miteinbeziehen, u.a. durch die Nutzung sozialer Medien, die Entwicklung, Verbreitung und Auswertung von Fragekatalogen zum gew\u00fcnschten Serviceangebot sowie die Ausschreibung und F\u00f6rderung von Pilotprojekten. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Erfahrungen sollen in den Aufbau und Entwicklungsprozess des NFDI4SD Eingang finden und sukzessive evaluiert werden. Ziel ist es, die Nachnutzbarkeit von Forschungsdaten durch verschiedenen Handlungsstrategien anzubieten und umzusetzen, da diese ansonsten aufgrund mangelnder Ressourcen \u2013 seien es Zeit, Know-how oder finanzielle Mittel \u2013 f\u00fcr die Allgemeinheit verlorengehen. An dieser Stelle wird ein weiteres Charakteristikum des NFDI4SD deutlich: Es werden ausdr\u00fccklich Projekte in verschiedenen Entwicklungsstadien, Gr\u00f6\u00dfenordnungen sowie mit variierender F\u00f6rderdauer angesprochen, von Qualifikationsprojekten wie Abschlussarbeiten und Dissertationen bis zu gr\u00f6\u00dferen Forschungsgruppen in Institutionen und Universit\u00e4ten. Gerade im Fall von Dissertationen ist in vielen Disziplinen bislang prim\u00e4r die abschlie\u00dfende Publikation von Forschungsresultaten Ma\u00dfstab des Gelingens eines Forschungsvorhabens, w\u00e4hrend zugrunde liegende Daten nicht kontextualisiert und systematisch erschlossen werden. Letztere k\u00f6nnen somit auch nicht von anderen zitiert werden bzw. m\u00fcssten hierf\u00fcr erneut bearbeitet werden. Bei umfangreicheren interdisziplin\u00e4ren Forschungsprojekten und Kollaborationen sind die durch die Kommunikation und Bewertungen aus verschiedenen Perspektiven gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und Teilergebnisse von besonderer Bedeutung. Die Ver\u00f6ffentlichung von Forschungsdaten und Teilergebnissen, die so eine st\u00e4rkere Dynamik und Relevanz f\u00fcr den Gesamtforschungsprozess entfalten, wird so erleichtert.

Im Zuge dieser Entwicklung haben sich wissenschaftliche Institutionen wie Universit\u00e4ten, Forschungseinrichtungen aber auch kleinere Gruppen und Akteure zur nachhaltigen Verwaltung und zum interdisziplin\u00e4ren Austausch von Forschungsdaten verpflichtet. Die Initiative zum Aufbau einer Nationalen Forschungsdateninfrastruktur tr\u00e4gt diesen massiven strukturellen Wandel Rechnung. Damit verbunden sind die systematische Planung, Sammlung, Verarbeitung, Analyse, Archivierung, Publikation und der Austausch von Daten unterschiedlichen Typs zur Wiederverwendung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft sowie durch eine breite interessierte \u00d6ffentlichkeit. Hierbei waren und sind insbesondere Geistes-, Kultur- und Sozialwissenschaften vor neue Herausforderungen gestellt, da Forschungsdatenmanagement und standardisierter Datenaustausch oft weniger selbstverst\u00e4ndlich in ihre disziplin\u00e4re Kultur und Infrastruktur integriert sind, als im Fall der Lebens- oder Naturwissenschaften. Die hiermit verbundenen Anforderungen sind gerade die sogenannten kleinen F\u00e4cher eine besonders schwer zu meistern. Hierzu geh\u00f6ren derzeit deutschlandweit \u00fcber 150 F\u00e4cher, \u00fcberwiegend geistes-, sozial- und kulturwissenschaftliche Disziplinen, die institutionell und ihrem Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis nach keine blo\u00dfen Teildisziplinen eines gr\u00f6\u00dferen Fachbereichs darstellen. 1 Die langfristige F\u00f6rderung und Sicherung des Fortbestehens dieser F\u00e4cher stellt ein hochrangiges hochschulpolitisches Ziel f\u00fcr die Lehr- und Forschungsinfrastruktur in Deutschland \u00fcberhaupt dar, wie Bundesbildungsministerin Anja Karliczek betont hat: \u201eAuf die vielen gro\u00dfen Fragen unserer Gesellschaft, nicht zuletzt was sie zusammenh\u00e4lt, geben die Kleinen F\u00e4cher wertvolle Antworten.

Die Leistungen der kleinen F\u00e4cher sind hinsichtlich ihrer gesellschaftlichen und wissenschaftlichen Bedeutung der Ergebnisse enorm: Die GEPRIS-Datenbank der DFG weist ein hohes F\u00f6rdervolumen aus, und der textliche Publikationsertrag ist erheblich. Auch die im Prozess der Forschung gewonnenen Daten, digitalisierten Ertr\u00e4ge und digitalen Repositorien beeindrucken. Es fehlen jedoch sekund\u00e4re Forschungsdaten, d. h., Daten auf der Basis digitaler Quellen, daraus abgeleitete Forschungsergebnisse und speziell f\u00fcr Forschungszwecke erzeugte Daten \u2013 der Umfang der FAIR publizierten sekund\u00e4ren Forschungsdaten im Verh\u00e4ltnis zu den Leistungsausweisen kleiner F\u00e4cher ist verschwindend gering. Dieses steht im Gegensatz zu ihrer enormen Bedeutung. Es sind diese Daten, die andere Daten und Repositorien erschlie\u00dfen. Sekund\u00e4rdaten sind der eigentliche Motor zuk\u00fcnftiger Digitalisierung. Sie verlinken die Best\u00e4nde miteinander und verkn\u00fcpfen Daten zu gehaltvollen Aussagen. Dieser Umstand ist nicht den Forscherinnen und Forschern anzulasten. Vielmehr kann es wesentlich auf eine fehlende Forschungsdateninfrastruktur zur\u00fcckgef\u00fchrt werden, woraus sich f\u00fcr das NFDI4SD folgende Konsequenzen ergeben: Das NFDI4SD integriert seine zahlreichen Forschungsdaten-Services in laufende Forschungsprojekte und kommt nicht erst zum Abschluss der Projekte zum Tragen. Die Services des NFDI4SD werden Teil des wissenschaftlichen Workflows und dienen nicht nur der Verwaltung und Dokumentation. Forschungsdaten umfassen prinzipiell ihren Gehalt (die eigentlichen Daten) und deren Paratext. APIs und andere Rechenoperationen (computational operations) beziehen sich immer auf die Einheit von Forschungsdaten und Metadaten. Die Entwicklung der Services des NFDI4SD wird durch die enge Einbindung in aktive Forschungsprojekte konsequent von den Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Anwendungen der Forscher selbst gesteuert. Das NFDI4SD zielt auf eine agile, umfassende Publikation der Forschungsdaten und deren FAIRe Weiternutzung durch die wissenschaftliche Gemeinschaft ab. Erprobte wissenschaftliche Publikationskonventionen werden sinngem\u00e4\u00df auf Datenpublikationen \u00fcbertragen. Computations sind Bestandteil des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitsprozesses, der anhand von \"computational notebooks\u201c der nach dem Konzept einer \u201eliterate science\u201c organisiert wird: Die Notebooks sind ausf\u00fchrbare Programme und dokumentieren zugleich im Detail \u2013 und somit f\u00fcr andere Forscherinnen und Forscher nachvollziehbar \u2013 die Arbeitsschritte durch Forschungsdaten. Die Infrastruktur des NFDI4SD orientiert sich konzeptuell an den Forschungsaktivit\u00e4ten der kleinen F\u00e4cher. Sie ist mit ihren Services offen f\u00fcr jedes wissenschaftliche Vorhaben, unabh\u00e4ngig von seiner disziplin\u00e4ren Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit. Forschungsgruppen bzw. Projekte aus den kleinen F\u00e4chern melden ihren Bedarf an Infrastrukturleistungen m\u00f6glichst fr\u00fchzeitig an (im Idealfall bereits vor Projektbeginn) und koordinieren mit dem NFDI4SD die gew\u00fcnschten Services. Damit kann die NFDI4SD bereits w\u00e4hrend des Forschungsprozesses konstruktiv mitwirken und die Erzeugung, Systematisierung, Bearbeitung und Auswertung der Forschungsdaten bis zur Datenpublikation \u2013 und der folgenden Weiternutzung \u2013 unterst\u00fctzen. Forschungsdaten werden vom NFDI4SD mit modernen Mitteln der Computational Sciences nutzbar gemacht: Sie werden selbst zu \"computational objects\" und schaffen damit die Basis f\u00fcr die Erschlie\u00dfung bislang nicht verf\u00fcgbarer Forschungspotentiale. Das NFDI4SD f\u00fchrt mit Forschungsdaten als \"computational objects\" gleichzeitig ein neues Forschungskonzept ein, wobei es sich hier nicht prim\u00e4r um technische Aspekte und Voraussetzungen handelt. Vielmehr werden Forschungsdaten neu verstanden und operational behandelt. Sie bilden die Synthese aus: (1) dem Gehalt der Daten (Text, Images, 3D-Objekte, Databasen, Programme) und (2) dem Paratext, also Informationen zur kontextuellen Umgebung der Forschungsdaten (etwa Metadaten oder Angaben zur Provenienz). Dieses B\u00fcndel an Eigenschaften und Informationen definiert die Forschungsdaten, die im wissenschaftlichen Workflow erzeugt, publiziert und weiterverwendet werden. Das daraus abgeleitete Verfahren erlaubt eine fruchtbare Zusammenarbeit aller internen und externen Mitwirkenden der Forschungsdateninfrastruktur mit ihren jeweils darauf zugeschnitten Aufgabenfeldern (task areas, kurz TA). Forschungsdaten werden bereits w\u00e4hrend der Projektf\u00f6rderung importiert, weiter bearbeitet sowie schnell und nachhaltig publiziert, beispielsweise als \"computational notebooks\". Mit der Registratur der Forschungsdaten des NFDI4SD wird ein weiteres wichtiges Ziel erreicht: Der vorgeschlagene Workflow macht die Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der Forschungsdaten untereinander transparent. Welche Forschungsdaten flie\u00dfen in die Berechnungen anderer ein? Wissenschaftler bzw. Nutzer erkennen damit kritische Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten eigener Daten und k\u00f6nnen die Geltungsbereiche von Forschungsdaten angesichts einer sich dynamisch ver\u00e4ndernden Forschungslandschaft besser einsch\u00e4tzen. Die Terminologie (also Fachsprache, disziplin\u00e4re Kategorisierungen oder Konventionen) zu den Forschungsobjekten wird von den Projekten und ihrer disziplin\u00e4ren Sprachverwendung weitgehend selbst entwickelt und im Austausch mit einer spezifischen Gemeinschaft standardisiert. In den meisten F\u00e4llen wird eine angemessene Nomenklatur also bereits durch die Forschungsprojekte vorgegeben, welche vom NFDI4SD f\u00fcr die Aufbereitung aller Daten verwendet wird. Jedes weitere Forschungsprojekt hilft dabei, ein Netzwerk semantischer verbundener Forschungsterminologien aufzubauen. In dieser Terminologie beschreiben die Forschungsdaten die Eigenschaften einer Gruppe von untersuchten Objekten und werden zur empirischen Grundlage f\u00fcr die Auswertung allgemeiner wissenschaftlicher Befunde. Die NFDI4SD Services sollen leicht verst\u00e4ndlich und ohne gro\u00dfe Einf\u00fchrung oder Studium von Handb\u00fcchern von allen Forschern genutzt werden k\u00f6nnen, die sich beim NFDI4SD angemeldet haben. Mit der Anmeldung erhalten Forscherinnen und Forscher die Zugangsberechtigung f\u00fcr die Cloud-Services des NFDI4SD. Wissenschaftler aller Qualifikationsstufen und Gruppengr\u00f6\u00dfen steuern \u00fcber die Bed\u00fcrfnisse ihrer Forschungsprojekte die Anforderungen an die NFDI4SD-Services. Eine Gruppe der Co-Spokesperson der task area TA1 (research fields) vermittelt und beobachtet den Abstimmungsprozess und bringt die Interessen der Forscher in das Steuerungsgremium der NFDI4SD ein. Mit schnell wachsendem Bedarf und zunehmender Differenzierung der Forschungsfelder wird die Gruppe der Co-Spokesperson aller Voraussicht nach erweitert werden. NFDI4SD-Services werden z.B. von der Arbeitsumgebung eines \"computational notebooks\" aufgerufen. Durch eine zus\u00e4tzliche Zeile im Notebook k\u00f6nnen die Funktionen anstatt von einer lokalen Installation auf die Nutzung von Cloud-Services des NFDI4SD umgeschaltet werden. TA2 entwickelt die Ressourcen f\u00fcr den NFDI4SD Cloud Service, insbesondere die innovativen Komponenten des Machine Learning und Big Data. TA3 entwickelt und betreibt alle Leistungen und Angebote, die aus der Sicht der Weiternutzung f\u00fcr eine hohe Sichtbarkeit der Forschungsdaten und die kollaborative Zusammenarbeit ben\u00f6tigt werden. Die Forschungsdatenpublikation geh\u00f6rt ebenso zu diesem Aufgabenfeld wie die Aus- und Weiterbildung. TA4 Die kollaborative Weiternutzung der Daten st\u00fctzt sich auf Normdaten und Standards. Nutzungsmetriken sowie laufende Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Qualit\u00e4tssicherung (quality assessment) des NFDI4SD geben sofortige R\u00fcckmeldungen f\u00fcr weitere Forschungsanforderungen. TA5 Ist die wichtige Schnittstelle zu allen institutionellen Partnern, externen Datenquellen und Forschungsrepositorien. Diese Abteilung arbeitet die Nutzungsvertr\u00e4ge mit den Partnern aus. Zudem wird von hier aus die Kommunikation der Forschungsdatenpublikation und der NFDI4SD-Services f\u00fcr die wissenschaftliche Community und die interessierte wissenschaftliche \u00d6ffentlichkeit koordiniert. Jede wissenschaftliche Publikation sowie jede Weiternutzung von Forschungsdaten betrifft Aspekte des Urheberrechtes. Forscher sollen bereits zu Beginn eines Projekts die rechtlichen Anforderungen angemessen ber\u00fccksichtigen k\u00f6nnen und werden dabei z. B. von Deep-Learning-Assistenten des NFDI4SD unterst\u00fctzt. NFDI4SD wird in TA6 die Mittel entwickeln, die Forschungsprojekte rechtzeitig auf die Anforderungen hinweisen und Nutzungsvorschl\u00e4ge im Interesse von Forschern und Wissenschaft unterbreiten. Der Mehrwert Researcher Konzeptionell werden Forschungsdaten neu verwendet. Durch einen Prozess vergleichbar mit der Verwandlung eines Manuskripts in ein Buch gestaltet das NFDI4SD aus rechnerischen Inhalten wissenschaftlich verwertbare Forschungsdaten. Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler k\u00f6nnen bereits w\u00e4hrend der Forschungsf\u00f6rderung zentrale Ergebnisse publizieren und in die Community einbringen: Die Resultate werden sofort dokumentiert und flie\u00dfen dann wieder in die eigenen Forschungen und die des Projektes ein. Das Konsortium NFDI4SD sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass wertvollen Forschungsertr\u00e4ge ohne zus\u00e4tzlichen Aufwand und Infrastrukturkosten langfristig erhalten und zug\u00e4nglich bleiben. Wissenschaftlicher Nachwuchs Das NFDI4SD unterst\u00fctzt die angehenden Forscherinnen und Forscher bereits zu Beginn ihrer Untersuchungen, wobei keine zus\u00e4tzlichen Ausgaben f\u00fcr diese anfallen. W\u00e4hrend des Schreibprozesses einer Dissertation k\u00f6nnen gleichzeitig erforderliche Forschungsdaten in einem Format erstellt werden, mit dem sie sowohl in der Arbeit als Zitate ausgewiesen als auch nach dem erfolgreichen Abschluss als Forschungsdaten zusammen mit der Dissertation ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden. Der zu erwartende wissenschaftliche Impact wird um ein Vielfaches gesteigert. Content provider, libraries, archives and repositories Die mittlerweile zug\u00e4nglichen digitalen Ressourcen der Bibliotheken, Archive, Repositorien und Forschungsinstitute erschlie\u00dfen einen wesentlichen Teil unseres kulturellen Erbes. Diese Quellen verdienen es, nicht nur passiv wahrgenommen zu werden. Mit dem neuen Konzept des NFDI4SD werden ihre Inhalte zu Forschungsdaten, die ohne erheblichen zus\u00e4tzlichen Aufwand direkt in den Forschungsprozess eingehen k\u00f6nnen. Der Paratext der Forschungsdaten erh\u00e4lt dabei nicht nur die Angaben des Urhebers und der bereitstellenden Institution. Die weitgehende Integration der Inhalte von Forschungsdaten sorgt auch daf\u00fcr, dass diese k\u00fcnftig in allen weiterf\u00fchrenden Forschungsdaten ausgewiesen werden. Der Wert institutioneller Forschungsdaten wird durch nachfolgende Publikationen zus\u00e4tzlich gesteigert. Gerade kleine Sammlungen und Spezialbest\u00e4nde gewinnen enorm an Bedeutung, weil sie in die Gesamtheit aller Best\u00e4nde gleichberechtigt und ohne Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe integriert werden. Die Forscherinnen der Zukunft werden virtuelle Sammlungen s\u00e4mtlicher Forschungsinstitutionen zur Erweiterung ihrer empirischen Basis nutzen k\u00f6nnen. Alle digitalisierten Inhalte profitieren von modernsten Machine-Learning-Techniken und einer globalen Vernetzung: So kann durch die Anwendung im Rahmen von Forschungsprojekten ohne Eigeninvestitionen der eigne Bestand erschlossen werden. Community Es werden Forschungsdaten verf\u00fcgbar gemacht, die bislang nach Projektabschluss unver\u00f6ffentlicht verschwanden. Man verstand Forschungsdaten als Mittel wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen, die zu Ergebnissen f\u00fchrten \u2013 sobald letztere publiziert waren, fehlte die Infrastruktur, um die Forschungsdaten als eigenst\u00e4ndige Forschungsertr\u00e4ge nutzbar zu machen und auszuweisen. K\u00fcnftig werden sich Forschungsdaten jedoch in allen Disziplinen und gerade in den kleinen F\u00e4chern zu eigenst\u00e4ndigen Publikationen entwickeln. Die Qualit\u00e4t und Bedeutung spezieller Forschungsgebiete f\u00fcr die Wissenschaft insgesamt kann damit gesteigert werden. Die Eigenst\u00e4ndigkeit der NFDI und der unterst\u00fctzenden Institutionen einer europ\u00e4ischen open science Infrastruktur wird eine digitale Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t sicherstellen. NFDI4SD wird ein Nutzungs- und Datenanalyse des wichtigsten Bestandes an Forschungsdaten der Kleinen F\u00e4cher vornehmen. Diese geh\u00f6ren zum Kernbestand des digital cultural heritage. Seine souver\u00e4ne und offene Pflege wird eine der wichtigsten Instrumente unseres cultural heritages. Funding institution Der wissenschaftliche Impact von gef\u00f6rderten Projekten wird viel schneller sichtbar und hilft den Akteuren dabei, Trends schnell zu erkennen und Bed\u00fcrfnisse nach neu ausgerichteten Forschungsfeldern empirisch zu untermauern. Der Wert der Forschungsf\u00f6rderungen steigert sich um ein Vielfaches, da die Leistungen der gef\u00f6rderten Projekte durch die Forschungsdateninfrastruktur unterst\u00fctzt werden.

Datenaggregation: Forschungsgegenst\u00e4nde einer Art werden oft umfassend, h\u00e4ufig als repr\u00e4sentative Teildaten ben\u00f6tigt: Dokumente zu einem Thema finden sich selten bereits aufbereitet in einer Datenquelle zusammengef\u00fchrt und aufbereitet. Auch sehr gro\u00dfe Bibliotheken und Archive f\u00fchren nur selten abgeschlossene Gesamtbest\u00e4nde. Die meisten Forschungsvorhaben sind auf eine eigene Zusammenf\u00fchrung der Forschungsgegenst\u00e4nde und einer Aufbereitung der Daten auf geeignete Datenformate angewiesen.","title":"Content provider"},{"location":"services/metadata/","text":"Paratext and Metadata Besides the content data, the paratext of research data contains different types of additional metadata. We cite the recommended metadata of the RDA, 4 and OpenAIRE: 3 Metadata is data providing information about data that makes findable, trackable and (re)usable. It can include information such as contact information, geographic locations, details about units of measure, abbreviations or codes used in the dataset, instrument and protocol information, survey tool details, provenance and version information and much more. The recommended set of paratext data will be discussed at the beginning of the NFDI4SD in workshops and expert consultations. Metadata will satisfy the required core (e.g. Dublin core, Datacite and OpenAIRE). We, therefore, apply the proposal of Datacite . Following considerations might be taken into account: Paratext data will best be coded as JSON-LD format, which as a lightweight Linked Data format allows a standardized API for complex hierarchical data structures. Its standards are ideal for an interoperable API, REST-services and Web interface. 1 Transformations into other formats and standards are planned. Core metadata, as required by ZENODO and generic data repositories, will be included in the set of metadata. Paratext will consist of the provenance of data to allow the composition of a data dependency graph. It will enable functions for the NFDI4SD registry to administer data dependencies and informative navigation through data repositories to the researcher. Many data provider - e.g. Bayerischer Staatsbibiothek M\u00fcnchen - as a pivotal content provider for digital ressources, has tagged exceptionally well their more than 2.5 mio digital objects and provides various RDF and XML structured metafiles. Their schema will be transparently used for the subsequent processing of research data for our researcher. A maximum of coherence of data and metadata is intended. Meaningful data APIs will be created along the lines of API considerations. Machine learning tools of the NFDI4SD will supply flexible mapping between user-specific terminology and data standards. Sufficient documentation of data, their origin, units, explanation of terms and cross-linking to standards of definition are recommended and will be assisted by appropriate tools using research feedback from the specific research community.

These semantic models interpret texts and can identify, e.g., epistemological evaluations of the author, derive inferences from them or compare the author's conclusions about their conflicts with the statements of other contemporaries. Semantic text analyses do not only regard the expression, but rather refer to the content. The fine art of machine learning interpretation shifts the question from \"what does the author write?\" to \"what does the author mean by his text?\". Part of this task uses NFDI4SD service of NLP pipeline path of identifying name entities (NER) used to itentify semantic components. They link syntactic properties of a text fragment with a general semantic feature, e.g. the expressions of various coordinates Kepler mentiones. Ambiguities or subtle additional semantical will be resolved to identify the implicit year for those reported positions. The use case demonstrates to the enormous potential of semantic modelling with automatic hermeneutics concerning the reading of Kepler\u2019s Astronomia Nova which currently is developed by a research project of BIFOLD Berlin Institute for Learning and Data ), project AP20.2. Four steps show the use and transformation of research data: (1) Research Data import of the English reference edition of Astronomia Nova a. The digital text is linked to the scholarly edition b.

These semantic models interpret texts and can identify, e.g., epistemological evaluations of the author, derive inferences from them or compare the author's conclusions about their conflicts with the statements of other contemporaries. Semantic text analyses do not only regard the expression, but rather refer to the content. The fine art of machine learning interpretation shifts the question from \"what does the author write?\" to \"what does the author mean by his text?\". Part of this task uses NFDI4SD service of NLP pipeline path of identifying name entities (NER) used to itentify semantic components. They link syntactic properties of a text fragment with a general semantic feature, e.g. the expressions of various coordinates Kepler mentiones. Ambiguities or subtle additional semantical will be resolved to identify the implicit year for those reported positions. The use case demonstrates to the enormous potential of semantic modelling with automatic hermeneutics concerning the reading of Kepler\u2019s Astronomia Nova which currently is developed by a research project of BIFOLD Berlin Institute for Learning and Data ), project AP20.2.
