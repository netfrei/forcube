# Epistemology of research data



The epistemological network of the NFDI4SD will be a novelty. Research data are usually published in logical isolation and, if necessary, searched through cataloguing categories. In the visualisation, different objects of research data are classified by category in a thematic cube.

The registry of the NFDI4SD enhances browsing in research data catalogues. It uses machine learning methods to create relationships between the data: Provenance or inferential relationships. These networks are created for all catalogued research data, not only those for which researchers have used the services of the NFDI.Similar to citation graphs of citations between publications, all accessible publications of research data are referentially linked with machine learning tools.


Deep learning models reveal the content and classify the research data on which the argumentation of the publications is epistemically based.These searches are initially prepared for the small subjects and can offer very substantial and specific support for the research projects.  The registry of the NFDI4SD creates a special **epistemic knowledge graph** for the most diverse contexts of research data:

## Impact Analysen

Usage relationships between research data show the wide range of uses. In the following diagram, the usage strands are represented by different widths of the zones.
