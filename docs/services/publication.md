 Research data require a publication for their full further use by others. Thus, the medial spectrum of publication extends to research data and other media that make direct use of research data. The methodological requirements for publications such as persistent identifier, quality assurance, archiving, review, citation, author attribution or cataloguing remain the same for all publication formats. Like all forms of publication, data are linked using cross-references to other publications with full citation and comprehensive bibliographic references.

## Research data on Zenodo

NFDI4SD support many data preparation serves to support researchs in their publication efforts.

- Standardisation: offers transformation into equivalent formats reducing variation of terminology and nomenclature.
- Computational assistants check data integrity, completeness, consistency
- Publicaton companion as a sophisticated reviewing service to interactively prepare research data together with the paratext for submission.

 We encourage the use of a newly created *NFDI4SD Community Collections* for text and data publications. As an example: the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System supports the publication of astronomy thesis in [Zenodo's Astronomy Thesis Collection](https://zenodo.org/communities/astrothesis?page=1&size=20).


 At the same time Zenodo both allows bulk uploading and harvesting its repositories. The policy allows NFDI4SD to implement a rapid <u>open science</u> publication workflow for its research bench implementation. A curated publishing setup from the implementation of NFDI4SD provides the best of two worlds for researchers using NFDI4SD services: research data will be curated and scrutinized by NFDI4SD research data compliances. Machine learning diagnostic tools support the composition of research data before they will be submitted for publication. Enhanced research metrics will supplement the NFDI4SD registry to document, display and facilitate collaborative usage of published research data by others.

 Creation of a DOI registered data submission on Zenodo ist straightforward and well established.[^doizen]

## Research data publication of repositories

 NFDI4SD will be instrumental in setting up large digital repositories. Depending on the size of data and demand of overall storage capacity designed recommendations and interfaces for long term data repositories will be provided. During the pilot period all existing large data repositories will be evaluated for its suitability and a matrix of evaluation criteria will be published.

## Interactive articles

Development of interactive articles is rapid with many scholarly attributes like mathematical typsetting, tables, crossreferences, footnotes and bibliographies including extended bibliographies of published research data. NFDI4SD will adopt and develop one interactive article framework with simlar objective as [distill journal](https://distill.pub/journal/) with [distill guide](https://distill.pub/guide/). A brilliant article about advantages of interactive articles has been published by [Hohmann, Conlen, Heer and Chau.](https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/)


However, destill's authoring process has to be much simplified and  especially expandedfor integrating research data publication. We believe that interative articles are the perfect platform for documenting and explaining published datasets.

NFDI4SD will develop an much more accessible authoring system with zero-additional-skill manuscript writing and support for extending research data inclusion. It will transform the presentation of research data beyond traditional forms of documentation.
